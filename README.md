# Don't buy it

Don’t Buy It is a website that helps users to make better purchase decisions and prevent impulse purchases by providing summaries of products that users are interested in buying. This could include reasons like inflated pricing or poor reviews from other customers. Providing pricing trends for a user’s desired product would give them a better idea about when to ake the purchase decision. Often times, the prices are seasonal in nature and a large discount could be offered by the manufacturer could be potentially offered. So holding off a big purchase could save a customer significant money. Additionally, the reviews of many products are scattered across multiple websites. We intent to apply NLP technologies summarize multiple reviews and highlight negative issues to customers so that they are aware of it.
