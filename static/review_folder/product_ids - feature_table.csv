4,resolution,11,"The TCL 3 Series S325 is an entry-level 1080p LED TV with mediocre picture quality. It has a very good contrast ratio but lacks a local dimming feature to deliver a great dark room performance. It can't get very bright to fight glare and is more suitable for a dim or an average-lit room where blacks will also look better. The TV doesn't support HDR, but on the upside, its SDR image accuracy is excellent. The gray uniformity is mediocre and some dirty screen effect is evident. Motion handling is decent and the input lag is very low for the highest supported resolution of 1080p @ 60Hz. The TV's Roku smart interface is the same as higher-end models, but it's not as smooth.",the highest supported resolution of 1080p @ 60Hz,

6,smart interface,,"The Amazon Fire TV 4-Series is a very basic, entry-level 4k TV. Along with the Fire TV Omni, it's one of the first Amazon-branded TVs. It's best-suited for a dark room, as the VA panel delivers deep blacks but can't get bright enough to overcome glare in a bright room. It has fantastic low input lag for gaming, but it doesn't support any advanced gaming features. The Fire TV smart interface is easy to use, and it has a great selection of additional apps, so you're sure to find your favorite streaming service. Unfortunately, it's not a very good TV overall, with poor viewing angles, mediocre gradient handling, and a slow response time. It has terrible accuracy out-of-the-box, and even calibrating it doesn't fix many issues with the accuracy, so the image looks off.",The Fire TV smart interface is easy to use,
