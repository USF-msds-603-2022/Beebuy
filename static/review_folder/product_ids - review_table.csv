2,1,Techradar,4,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-fire-tv-omni-series,Amazon’s Omni TV is surprisingly good for its affordable sticker price,"Amazon’s announcement that it would create its own series of TVs came as a surprise, but the company has clearly done its homework. The Amazon Omni TV offers a bright, colorful 4K/HDR screen with a smart platform and Alexa integration for a meager sum. While we’d consider the Omni TV more of a budget model in line with the TCL 4-Series and Vizio V-Series, it performs much closer to a mid-range model with its above-average brightness and color saturation. Contrast is still a sour point, though, and you might notice some screen lighting uniformity issues as we did with our review sample. For gamers, the 60Hz native panel refresh rate and single HDMI 2.1 port will likely – and rightfully – be deal-breakers. But smart home enthusiasts may find some joy in having an Alexa-imbued TV that can control their doorbell cameras and smart lights. t’s not going to challenge an LG OLED or Samsung QLED for best picture quality, but if you want a competent budget screen with some handy features, the Amazon Omni TV delivers an experience that punches well above its price tag.The Amazon Omni TV was released in 2021 and is available in five different sizes, ranging from 43 inches to 75 inches.In terms of pricing, the Omni TV’s list price starts at $400 for the 43-inch model, however, it can often be found for under $300. A 4K TV for less than $300? That’s exciting in and of itself. Stepping up to the 65-inch ($600) and 75-inch ($899) versions will bring Dolby Vision support to the table. As both remain at the 60Hz native refresh rate, don’t expect any improvement to the motion processing, though.From an aesthetic standpoint, Amazon doesn’t try to do much out of the ordinary with the Omni TV. The 43-, 50- and 55-inch models have a black bezel around all sides and black u-shaped feet supporting the TV near the outer edges, while the 65- and 75-inch variants have a silver bezel along the bottom and silver feet. All models have a built-in microphone for Alexa located at the bottom of the screen. It will light up when it hears the wake word (for most folks, that’s “Alexa”) and you can talk to it just like any other Echo device. Spin the TV around to the back and you’ll find a decent amount of ports to pick from. There are three regular HDMI 2.0a ports and one HDMI 2.1 eARC port that you can use to connect a soundbar. Obviously having more HDMI 2.1 ports would be better, but it doesn’t matter much considering this is only a 60Hz television.In terms of panel design, you’re looking at a direct-lit LED-LCD screen. A lack of local dimming hurts the overall package, as that’s something even Vizio includes on its entry-level TVs – we’ll cover the full implications of that in the performance section. Inside the box, you’ll get a plastic remote that can also be used for voice commands if you’re sitting further away from the TV or want to walk into another room for a minute and still give the TV some commands, like changing the music.In terms of design, everything is pretty face-value here. That all changes when you start talking about the Omni TV’s feature set and performance.Features are a bit of a mixed bag for the Amazon Omni TV. On the one hand, it’s tremendous value getting a smart TV with Alexa voice recognition for a pittance, but on the other, you do miss out on a number of niceties like Dolby Vision. Moreover, some of the advertised features, like Casting, don’t always go smoothly and may require a few attempts to get working.Leet's start off with the good points. Setup is incredibly easy, especially if you have an Amazon account already. You’ll basically just need to enter some Wi-Fi information and log in to your Amazon account to link the TV, and then you’re done. You’ll also get the benefit of Fire TV’s new UI right out of the box. It’s clean and simple to understand, plus it puts content first. Sure, most of that content is going to lean heavily in the favor of Amazon’s own service, but it is nice seeing a row of recommendations front and center. Despite being Android-based, Fire TV is definitely a different beast than both Android TV and the newer Google TV that the company rolled out two years ago. Ads are a bit more prevalent on Fire TV and the whole ecosystem feels a bit more confined to Amazon devices.That last bit isn’t so bad, though, especially if you use other Amazon smart home devices. Being able to use the built-in Alexa to turn off the porch light at the end of the night or turn on the front door camera when a package is delivered are both handy features. Other TVs promise this level of integration, but due to Amazon already having your smart home devices’ information in the Alexa app, you can talk to the TV just like you would any other Echo device in your house. It’s extremely convenient. The other benefit of having Alexa built-in is that you’ll be able to control the TV without picking up the remote. For us, that was often as simple as turning the TV on using our voice, turning the TV to HDMI 1 that had the Xbox Series X hooked up to it, then turning off the TV with our voice when we were done for the day – no remote necessary.In terms of connecting the TV to other apps, we had some successes and some failures. Connecting to YouTube by Casting was always hit-or-miss (mostly miss), but we had no problems getting Spotify Connect to work after we installed the Spotify app on the TV.In the picture-quality department, the Amazon Omni is a surprising star among some of its dimmer, less colorful rivals. Even with its normal out-of-the-box setting with no calibration, the Omni TV dazzles with its bright highlights and deep colors. It makes most HDR games and movies look absolutely phenomenal. Obviously, this TV was built for 4K HDR content so that’s where things look the best. Playing games on an Xbox Series X and PS5 look fantastic, despite not being able to run at 120Hz. The colors in shows like Chef’s Table and The Witcher (both available in 4K HDR on Netflix) pop off the screen in vibrant hues. That said, while colors and peak luminance push well above their weight here, contrast isn’t the TV’s best strength. On gray screens, it’s easy to see where there are uniformity issues with the Omni TV’s direct backlight with some patches of LEDs shining brighter than others. This can make for poor black levels when you’re watching a night or space scene.Additionally, motion processing is fine right out of the box with no obvious artifacting in any of the content we watched – you’re not always getting the smoothest response when watching fast sequences like a Formula 1 race or a football game on TV. You also should watch out for issues with upscaling. While the Omni TV does a decent job taking 1080p content and upscaling it to fit the 4K screen, it’s not perfect. You won’t see any grain, but you might see a slightly softer picture than you would on a mid-range model.All of these issues should give you pause, honestly, but for TVs in this price range, these issues are often significantly worse. With that in mind, Amazon’s first outing is a success in terms of picture quality, in our opinion.Rocking two 8W down-firing speakers, don’t expect much from the Amazon Omni TV in terms of great audio quality. Dialogue was often quite hard to hear unless the audio was cranked up to 40 or 50 and the balance never seemed to be quite right no matter which audio preset or volume level we picked. Just as bad, sound reproduction is pretty flat. Again, this really isn’t uncommon on a TV in this price range, but it does mean that movies and music sound a bit less impactful than they would on a higher-end model. You could, of course, fix this by adding on a soundbar that's capable of accepting a Dolby Atmos signal and an external device like an Apple TV 4K or Xbox Series X. Otherwise, however, you’ll have to stick with Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 sound instead of a 7.1.2 soundbar.That said, Amazon does have one trick up its sleeve to help make the situation a little better for fledgling home audio enthusiasts. It allows you to use an Amazon Echo device as a surround sound speaker. The setup for this isn’t all that intuitive (you need to go into the Alexa app, then tap the plus symbol to add a new home theater group) but once done you can funnel the sound away from the TV’s speakers to up to two Echo or Echo Studio devices and a subwoofer. That’s going to greatly enhance your sound quality and is well worth looking into, especially if you have extra Amazon Echo speakers lying around.

3,1,Verge,7,https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa,Amazon’s first TV has an appealing price and useful features but isn’t on par where it counts,"You’d expect a lot from Amazon’s first self-branded TVs. After building a successful hardware business with its Echo smart devices and Fire TV streaming gadgets, now the tech giant wants to put its name on the biggest screen in your home. The new Fire TV Omni series delivers 4K HDR picture in multiple sizes that start at aggressively low prices: the 50-inch model costs $359.99 at the time of this review. Only the largest 65-inch and 75-inch models include Dolby Vision HDR, which, in Amazon’s own words, allows for “a more cinematic experience.” All of the Omni TVs run Amazon’s Fire TV software and have built-in mics for hands-free Alexa voice commands — even when the screen is off. There’s also a cheaper Fire TV 4-Series on sale now, but I’m reviewing the higher-end series.In some ways, Amazon’s new effort shows big promise. The Alexa integration is more thorough and full-featured than what you’d get using a Fire TV stick: in addition to launching your favorite streaming apps or searching for content with your voice, you can also switch between TV inputs. And you can query Alexa when the TV’s display is fully off for simple information like the weather or to play music. The Omni also supports features like Apple AirPlay 2, which Amazon’s streaming players still do not, and you can plug a webcam into the TV’s USB port for video calls with Echo Show devices right now and Zoom and other apps later on.But Amazon’s first TVs underwhelm in the all-important area of picture quality, and they rank below competition from TCL, Vizio, Hisense, and other TV makers that play in the same price range. There’s nothing inherently terrible about the viewing experience on the Fire TV Omni. If you’re someone who’s easy to please, you might be totally satisfied. But Amazon has made a few too many hardware compromises for me to recommend its new TV lineup to people who want the best picture for their money.Before going further, I have to note that while Amazon claims these are “Amazon-built TVs,” they are almost certainly being manufactured by TCL. There are unmistakable hardware similarities between them, from the general overall design to the I/O port layout. I’m sure Amazon had some input into the final product (especially with regards to the Alexa integration), but there’s no denying who the company contracted to produce these.The 55-inch model I tested has black bezels, though there’s a slimmer silver trim on the 65-inch and 75-inch Dolby Vision sizes. Centered below the bottom bezel is an LED indicator for the far-field microphone array: a blue light illuminates when the “Alexa” wake word is detected (and you’ll see the familiar long blue line across the lower portion of the TV screen). If you’re not a fan of your TV having built-in microphones, you can disable them by flipping a switch that’s on the TV’s underside. A red light indicates that the mics have been turned off, and you’re still free to use voice commands with the Alexa Voice Remote in this scenario.As for port selection, the Omni includes three HDMI 2.0 ports and a single HDMI 2.1 eARC port that can take advantage of the latest and greatest soundbars. There’s also cable / antenna input, ethernet, a USB 2.0 port, optical audio out, a headphone jack, and a port for the IR emitter that Amazon also includes in the box. That IR emitter can be used to control your other home theater gear and gives the Omni some very rudimentary universal remote capabilities, much like the Fire TV Cube.Similar to existing “Fire TV Edition” TVs from Toshiba and Insignia, Amazon’s Omni TVs run the company’s Fire TV software with a few extra tweaks for TV inputs, picture settings, and so on. But general navigation, browsing content, and streaming all feel the same here as on a Fire TV Stick 4K. All of the major streaming apps you’d want are accounted for, even if the interface continues to put a bigger emphasis on Prime Video content than anything else. In most cases, Alexa’s responses were identical to those I’ve received on a Fire TV streaming device. You’re not really gaining any major new functionality with the Omni, but assuming you don’t have an Echo speaker in the same room, it’s nice being able to ask for the basics (like turning off a nearby smart bulb) with the screen off. Another potential benefit of going with this TV is that you’ll receive new software updates long into the future, though the same can be said for Roku TVs.It’s when you start watching movies and TV shows on the Fire TV Omni that it becomes clear Amazon settled for average picture quality. These TVs use a direct LED backlight and lack any kind of local dimming that can produce deeper black levels by illuminating and dimming “zones” of the screen as necessary. So the contrast on Amazon’s TV falls short of what you’d find on something like TCL’s 5-Series or Vizio’s M-Series. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s noticeable. I’m disappointed that Amazon went such a basic route — particularly on the larger screen sizes — and picture quality suffers for it. Black levels aside, I’ve found general HDR10 performance across several movies to be respectable for the price range of this 55-inch model, though Digital Trends was disappointed by the maximum HDR brightness levels on the Dolby Vision-capable Omni. This is another area where it’s evident that Amazon isn’t trying to outshine the competition and instead settling for “passable.”Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we’re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.Using a Fire TV Omni requires an Amazon account, which means you’ll have to agree to the company’s conditions of use and privacy notice to get started. It’s also important to be aware of privacy settings for Amazon’s Alexa since the voice assistant plays such a large role on this device.The Fire TV platform comes with its own privacy settings (enabled by default) that allow Amazon to:“Use personal data collected by the operating system of this device for marketing and product improvement purposes.” “Allow Appstore to collect information on the frequency and duration of use of downloaded apps.”There’s also an “interest-based ads” option that lets you opt out of apps using your device’s advertising ID to build a profile for targeted ads. Separate from this, you can choose to reset your advertising ID.Final tally: two mandatory agreements, plus Alexa privacy policy and data sharing settings that are specific to Fire TV.You aren’t going to be gaming at 120Hz with your PS5 or Xbox Series X on the Fire TV Omni: this is a 60Hz panel, and it also lacks variable refresh rate. But there’s at least support for auto low latency mode (ALLM), and Amazon fares impressively well at cutting down input lag when gaming mode is active. It’ll work for gaming but definitely doesn’t check every box that new console owners are looking for.At review time, there are still several features of the Fire TV Omni listed as “coming soon,” such as the aforementioned AirPlay 2 support and the ability to use Echo speakers for home theater sound. A native Zoom app has also yet to appear.My overall takeaway after testing the Fire TV Omni is that it’s an attractively priced 4K TV with convenient voice controls — but only so-so picture quality. Amazon really needs to do better at that criteria next time around. You can buy a TCL 6-Series Roku TV with fantastic picture quality for not much more. Google TV runs on gorgeous Sony OLEDs and now a high-end TCL TV with Mini LED. Unfortunately for Amazon, the Fire TV Omni’s viewing experience doesn’t really come close to any of those. At the end of the day, you’re better off choosing a TV with better picture quality and throwing in a Fire TV Stick 4K Max if you prefer Amazon’s streaming platform. But while this might be an underwhelming first attempt at “the Amazon TV” for nerds like myself, I wouldn’t count Amazon out. The prices alone might be enough to sell some people on the Fire TV Omni. And if the company can maintain similar prices and dial up the picture quality of its eventual second-gen TVs, the whole concept will be all the more appealing. If there’s one thing we know about Amazon hardware, it’s that the company is willing to improve it, and quickly."
4,1,Tom's guide,3.5,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/amazon-fire-tv-omni,"A pretty-looking Fire TV, but the Omni's performance falls flat","The Amazon Fire TV Omni is a big deal for Amazon, and Fire TV has never looked better, or been easier to use. But with disappointing performance and a price that's a little more premium than it deserves, it's not likely to make a splash.Amazon has dabbled in the smart TV game for a few years now, letting TV manufacturers use the same software found on some of the best streaming devices, like the Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Fire TV Cube to power value priced smart TVs. But the Amazon Fire TV Omni series represents a pretty dramatic change to that formula, as the first Amazon-powered smart TV to carry the Amazon brand instead of another manufacturer, as well as the first of likely many Fire TV models with built-in far field microphones for hands-free voice control. Amazon's smart TV software has always been at its best when showcasing built-in Alexa functionality, but the Amazon Fire TV Omni series takes this to a new level, enhancing that capability and pairing it with a better looking TV than any Fire TV we've seen before. It's not a perfect product, but our Amazon Fire TV Omni review explores the many ways Amazon tries to make its new Fire TV the best Fire TV.Amazon released two new Fire TV model lines under the Amazon brand this year, the Omni and the 4-Series Fire TV. Of the two, the Omni is the more premium version, offering a higher-end design and boasting built-in features (like hands-free Alexa) that the 4-Series does not.Our review centered around the 65-inch Fire TV Omni, which sells for $829 through Amazon and Best Buy.Of these several model sizes, most of the features are identical. The Fire TV software is the same as any other Fire TV, but the TV does have additional hardware to offer support for features like hands-free Alexa control.The one key difference between the different screen size options is the addition of Dolby Vision HDR content, which is only supported on the 65 and 75-inch models. But, since none of the Amazon Fire TV Omni models have local dimming, the actual impact of this format support is limited.With the caveat that not all models have Dolby Vision, our general impressions of the 65-inch model we tested should apply equally to any screen size in the Omni model line.By most measures the new Amazon Fire TV Omni series is the best looking Fire TV yet. The design improves upon past Fire TV models with a more streamlined chassis and silver-toned highlights that look a lot better than the boxy black plastic that featured on Fire TVs past. Much narrower bezels, metal trim, and sturdy metal feet mark this as a far more premium product. The back of the chassis is basic matte black plastic, as expected, but instead of the usual boxy design favored by many cheap TVs, Omni takes a sleeker approach, with rounded edges and rounded tapered edges. We've come a long way from the 2017 Westinghouse Amazon Fire TV, with its plasticy construction and chunky design.Measuring 57.1 x 33.3 x 2.9 inches and at 42.5 pounds, it's easily assembled and mounted by two people. If you want to hang it on the wall, the TV will accept any 400 millimeter x 200 millimeter VESA hardware, including those found in our list of the best TV mounts.Most other details will be discussed elsewhere in this review, but one stood out for its design as much as the functionality. Just below the display is a small bar, which includes a hardware switch, that deactivates the built-in far field microphones that the TV uses for room-listening Alexa interaction. The switch is easy to access, and easy to switch back and forth, but it's a little hard to tell what's on and what's off. Thankfully, there's also an easy to see LED indicator that glows red when the mics are disabled.The Omni series is outfitted with three HDMI 2.0 ports and a single HDMI 2.1 port with eARC. There's an Ethernet port to complement the built-in 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and a single USB port. The TV also boasts a coaxial connection for antenna and cable, a 3.5 millimeter audio jack for speakers or headphones, and an optical digital audio output for connecting older sound equipment.There's also a connection for an included IR emitter. This unusual feature lets you use the TV's built-in Alexa capabilities to control other devices in your home entertainment setup, with the TV using the IR emitter to control any hardware that would normally require a standard remote control. In some ways, it’s similar to some of the best universal remotes.The biggest promise of the Fire TV Omni is in performance. The 65-inch screen is bigger than most Fire TVs, and offers support for HDR formats like HDR10 and Dolby Vision. And, given the higher price tag and more stylish design, it's entirely reasonable to think that the Omni would outperform other Fire-powered smart TVs.Unfortunately, that was only partly true. During my time with the TV, I couldn't help but feel that the set was held back by the relatively basic LCD panel and direct LED backlight.Watching The Tomorrow War, Chris Pratt's time-displaced soldier looked good in action scenes, with decent motion handling preventing most of the obvious judder or smearing you might see on a cheaper set. The 4K panel handled the basics of resolution and color fairly well, and the CGI aliens look properly detailed in all their toothy glory.HDR content offers a good differential between dark and bright, though some dark scenes lose a little bit of detail in shadowy scenes. One scene inside a dark alien ship provided a good showcase for the TV's HDR capabilities. Handheld flashlights lit up as blazing bright points of light, and as they swept across the dark, alien ship interiors the HDR managed to preserve the illumination of the flashlight beams without losing the depth of the darker environment. It wasn't perfect, and the shadowy portions of the scene often lost some detail into a mass of undifferentiated darks, but it was about as good as you can get from direct LED backlighting without any discrete dimming zones.Looking at single-color test screens the Omni offered surprisingly decent viewing angles, with noticeable color shifting beyond 45 degrees from center, but not drastic. Tones remain recognizable, if a little washed out, but even out at steep angles content should be pretty watchable.The TV also handled color fairly well. Watching scenes from CGI-animated kids shows Lost in Oz, the bright palette of colors seemed vibrant and varied. Reds and pinks looked a bit oversaturated, but otherwise, the color reproduction looked fine to the unaided eye. Contrast leaves a bit to be desired, and the brightness may need some adjustment, but the overall result is inoffensive.Bright single-color test screens do show some slight vignetting on the corners of the screen, and back light isn't perfectly consistent, but you'll only notice it in certain circumstances. When viewing normal content, with varied backgrounds and moving objects and people on screen, it's not noticeable at all.Switching between standard and movie mode did offer noticeable improvement in picture quality, switching to a different color temperature and offering more lifelike skin tones without significantly sacrificing the range of color available.As expected, the TV offers decent 4K gaming support at up to 60 Hz, but no higher, since the TV uses a 60Hz panel. The TV does support HDR10 and Dolby Vision for gaming, and supports 10-bit color at 24, 50 and 60 Hz refresh rates.Automatic switching to game mode was simple and seamless. Play testing with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I was pleased to see decent color quality in everything from sundrenched Viking villages to abstracted glowing interfaces, and HDR content seemed to display properly with a healthy mix of bright glow and deep shadows.Our lab testing detailed the good and bad of the Fire TV Omni, and while the TV isn't bad to look at, it's hardly the best you can get for the money. It's (mostly) a step up from our previous favorite Amazon smart TV, the Toshiba C350 Fire TV, thanks to hands-free control and a slick new design, but it's a closer match up than it probably should be given the nearly $300 price difference between the two. And compared with competitors like the Vizio M-Series Quantum MQ6 and the TCL 5-Series Roku TV (S535), it's clear that Amazon's first Fire TV still has room for improvement.The Amazon Omni offered middling color gamut performance, reproducing 96% of the Rec 709 color space. While that is an improvement over the Toshiba C350 Fire TV (95%), it's still a far cry from the TCL 5-Series Roku TV (99.8%) and the Vizio M-Series Quantum MQ6 (99.96%). It's also worth noting that these less expensive competitors offer one other thing that the Omni does not: QLED. Quantum dot enhancement delivers better color and brightness, and it's almost become a standard feature in this price range, but there are no QLED options in the Fire TV family.Color accuracy tests told a similar story. The Omni's Delta-E average of 4.4 isn't great (closer to zero is better) – it's more common in the bargain-priced models we usually see Fire TV running on. But compared to the competition, it's another point against the Omni. The TCL 5-Series Roku TV (1.76) and the Vizio MQ6 (1.68) both fall into the pretty great category with excellent out-of-the-box accuracy, and even the Toshiba C350 Fire TV did better (1.67).The one area where the Omni managed to hold its own was brightness. With a measured peak brightness of 494 nits, it surpassed both QLED competitors like the TCL 5-Series (391 nits) and the Vizio M-Series MQ6 (299 nits), as well as the previous top Fire TV, the Toshiba C350 (227 nits).Gaming was another matter. When tested with a 4K Leo Bodnar signal lag tester, the Omni had a lag time of 9.8 milliseconds. That's an excellent result, and one that puts it alongside the Vizio M-Series Quantum MQ6 (10ms) and the Toshiba C350 Fire TV (9.7ms).For being Amazon's top-of-the-line Fire TV, the Omni has surprisingly pedestrian audio. With a pair of 8-watt speakers providing stereo sound, the TV offers reasonably loud volume levels, but when set to the levels that are likely to be used for casual TV watching, the TV struggles with bass – bass comes through nicely above 20% volume, but any quieter and the low-end drops out completely, throwing off the mix. Whether we were watching the opening raid in Michael B. Jordan's Without Remorse or the crazy land of Oz in Lost in Oz, the Omni did provide decent clarity of dialogue and sound effects. At mid-range volumes (between 30 and 60%), the TV does produce a solid mix of bass and treble, and even manages to avoid some of the distortion we commonly hear at higher volumes. The stereo speakers also provide decent right/left separation.However, if you want fuller, richer sound than the TV's 8-watt speakers can produce, you'll do well to get one of the best soundbars to level up the audio. The Omni's built-in speakers are good, but not great, on their own.Compared to other affordable smart TV platforms, Amazon Fire TV is one of the smartest you can get. That starts with built-in Alexa, complete with far field microphones built into the TV that listen to the room the same way an Amazon Alexa speaker does.A physical switch lets you turn the microphones off if the idea of your TV listening to all of your conversations makes your privacy radar sound an alarm. But that's not the only way to enjoy voice control, since the remote offers a built-in microphone with simple press-to-talk access for Alexa control.In our testing, Alexa was quick and responsive, whether I used the room-listening microphones or the mic-enabled remote control. Finding and playing content was simple, with the ability to search for shows by title or genre, or to search for everything done by a certain actor or director.Control of basic TV functions, from power and volume control to turning on closed captions or opening specific apps, was all smooth and functioned without the sort of irritating repetition that used to plague many voice interaction features. With all of the polish that Amazon has given Alexa over the last several years, the Omni boasts one of the most usable voice control features I've tested.The growing list of Alexa skills and smart home capabilities is also quite impressive. You can control a huge number of smart home devices with spoken commands, and you can use the TV's included IR blaster to also control non-smart devices like Blu Ray players and cable boxes. Future smart features include functions like Zoom calling when a compatible USB camera is plugged in. Other promised features will include the Alexa Shortcut Panel, which will let you select common Alexa skills using the directional pad of the remote, instead of voice command, and Alexa Home Theater, which will use Echo speakers to pair wirelessly through the Alexa app to create a multi-channel surround sound setup. (However, it bears repeating, these are forthcoming smart features we could not test during our evaluation, though we'll revisit them when the opportunity comes up.)The recently-revamped Amazon Fire TV interface is a little cleaner and more easily navigated than in the past. With multiple rows of content suggestions organized by recently used apps, recommendations of free and premium content, movies and shows on Amazon owned services like Prime Video and IMDb TV. But it does this without relegating other apps and services to the lower (and less-visible) parts of the menu, instead focusing on offering what the user wants to see from their own preferred apps. Amazon still gets a prominent place in the mix, but it's better tuned in to the reality of users that may be subscribed to several streaming services. Overall it's an improved interface, and it offers a lot more than Fire TV seemed to in previous iterations.The app store is also greatly improved, with more highlights right at the outset, including both free and paid streaming services, sports apps, cable replacement services, new releases and Alexa-enabled services. It also has a small selection of recommended games, for those few people who care about running games on their smart TV.Outside of those highlights, the app browsing experience is much better than it used to be, with a tile-based interface that offers little thumbnail images to give you a sense of what the app is about. It's not perfect, and the app selection still has more than the usual number of low quality apps with questionable value, but finding what you want should be easier than ever before.The remote that comes with the Fire TV Omni will look extremely familiar to anyone who's used a Fire TV product in the past, with the fairly simple design dominated by a ring-shaped directional pad, some basic media control buttons, volume control and a few additional buttons you won't find on the remotes of Fire TV devices like the Cube.Volume control is joined by channel up and down buttons, and a live TV button lets you jump right to your antenna or cable channel guide. It also has buttons for muting audio, accessing settings menus and even picture-in-a-picture. The remote has four dedicated app buttons for Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu.A dedicated button up top lets you activate Alexa and speak directly into the mic enabled remote control if you are not using the TV's built-in far-field mics.The Amazon Fire TV Omni is clearly a play to deliver a more premium Fire TV experience, from the improved design to the introduction of currently-exclusive features, like hands-free Alexa, and the promise of being the first to roll out upcoming features, like video calling. And it makes sense, this is Amazon's first Fire TV to get designed in-house and bear the Amazon brand name. It's also the most expensive Fire TV yet.But the more luxe look and refreshed interface run headlong into the reality of the hardware. With a middling display and speakers, the more premium Fire TV Omni doesn't deliver a better experience where it counts most: In viewing TV and movies. Instead, it offers a better version of what came before, a great platform for Alexa fans and Amazon Prime Video diehards, but a smart TV experience that still finds itself falling behind other affordable offerings.At this price, other smart TVs deliver better picture, thanks to QLED displays and backlights with local dimming. The editor's choice TCL 6-Series Roku TV easily outpaces it, but even the step down TCL 5-Series Roku TV (S535) delivers better value at a better price. And, unfortunately, the Omni isn't even the best Fire TV on the market. The more affordable Toshiba C350 Fire TV may not have room-listening mics for Alexa use, but it delivers better picture performance than the Omni, while still providing all of the other perks of Fire TV.The Amazon Fire TV Omni is a good TV, but it's not a great TV. It will sell well, thanks to aggressive promotion from Amazon and Best Buy, likely with big sales discounts this holiday season, and it will put the first Amazon-made smart TV into homes across the country and globe. But if Amazon really wants a standout smart TV to showcase Fire TV and all its capabilities, I hope the next generation Omni is better than this one.

5,1,PC Magazine,3.5,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/amazon-fire-tv-omni-65-inch,"Amazon's first attempt at making its own television, the Fire TV Omni offers an impressive range of features for the price, tempered by average picture quality.","The Fire TV platform has driven Amazon’s own media streamers as well as many third-party TVs for years, but until now the company hasn't made any of its own TVs. The Omni is one of Amazon’s first Fire TV-powered televisions, as well as the highest-end model in its new lineup. At $829.99 for the 65-inch model we tested, the Omni still leans more toward the budget-friendly end of the spectrum than flagship, and its picture quality reflects that. But it's packed with all the powerful features of Fire TV, including hands-free Alexa voice control, making it a compelling option for a new smart TV that won't break the bank.The Omni perks up an otherwise nondescript design with a bit of chrome around the edges. The screen is framed by an almost-as-thin black border, giving it a nearly bezel-less look. Only the bottom edge has a bezel, a gunmetal strip with the Fire TV logo in the middle and a small protrusion with near-field microphones below that (a small switch on the underside turns off the mics). The TV stands on two widely placed, metal, V-shaped legs, or it can be mounted on the wall.A power connector sits on the left side of the back panel, with all other connections facing right. They include four HDMI ports (one eARC), a USB 2.0 port, an optical audio output, a 3.5mm headphone jack, another 3.5mm port for the included IR emitter, an Ethernet port, and a cable/antenna connector.The remote is similar to the ones included with Fire TV media streamers. It’s a flat, slightly rounded black rectangle with a large, circular navigation pad near the top. Power and Alexa buttons, along with a pinhole microphone, sit above the pad. Menu and playback controls are below the pad, with channel and volume rockers below them. Four dedicated service buttons for Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, and Netflix can be found near the bottom. The remote connects wirelessly to the TV so you don’t need line of sight, but it also has an IR emitter. Another IR emitter on a long cable can be run into a cabinet to control your other home theater devices through the TV and the remote.As its name indicates, the Omni runs on Amazon’s Fire TV platform, like the Toshiba C350 and Amazon’s own Fire TV media streamers. It provides a feature-rich, Amazon-centric interface with a wide selection of apps and services. Amazon Prime Video is of course integrated directly into the platform, but all of the major non-Amazon streaming services are also available, including Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Twitch, and YouTube. A live guide is built into the interface, showing channels from streaming live TV services, Amazon channels, and Pluto TV.Fire TV lags a bit behind Google TV and Roku TV in device mirroring. You can mirror your computer screen over WiDi/Miracast, but there’s no Apple Airplay or Google Cast for simple and convenient smartphone or computer mirroring.On the plus side, the Omni offers Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. Alexa is standard on all Fire TV media streamers and TVs, available by pressing and holding the Alexa button on the remote and talking into it. However, the Omni adds far-field microphones, so you can simply talk to the TV the way you can with a smart speaker like the Amazon Echo or the Fire TV Cube (the only other Fire TV device with hands-free Alexa). Just say “Alexa,” followed by a command, and Alexa will answer and display any relevant information on the TV.Alexa is a powerful voice assistant, and can search for content, control the TV and any compatible smart home devices, answer general questions, and display your calendar and reminders. If you don’t want Alexa to always be listening, you can flip the switch on the underside of the TV to disable the microphone, and a small red LED will light up to indicate the mic is off.The mic also enables voice calls with Alexa Communications. You can make phone calls through the TV, contact other Alexa users through Drop In, or join one-way video calls with Amazon Chime, Skype, or Zoom. You can even make two-way video calls through those services by plugging in a compatible Logitech webcam (C310, C920x, or C922x Pro).The Amazon Fire TV Omni is a 4K TV with a 60Hz refresh rate. It supports high dynamic range (HDR) content in HDR10 and hybrid log gamma (HLG), and the 65- and 75-inch versions also support Dolby Vision, but not the smaller screen sizes. We test TVs using a Klein K-80 colorimeter, a Murideo SIX-G signal generator, and Portrait Displays’ Calman software using methodology based on Imaging Science Foundation’s calibration techniques.The Omni’s contrast numbers are unimpressive. Its direct LED backlight system doesn’t get particularly bright, and it doesn’t have zone dimming to improve black level. This means we got nearly identical numbers whether we used an SDR or HDR signal, or a full-screen white or 18% white field to measure light output. We measured an average peak brightness of 333.653cd/m^2 across those four conditions in Movie mode with the backlight set to maximum, with variations of only 3cd/m^2 between them. Black levels were just as disappointing, showing a fairly high 0.11cd/m^2 for an effective contrast ratio of 3,033:1. The Vizio MQ6-J is a bit dimmer (256.623cd/m^2 with an HDR signal showing an 18% field), but it can also get darker (0.062cd/m^2), for a better contrast ratio (4,139:1). If you can find them, spending a few hundred dollars more on the slightly older Hisense H8G or TCL R635 will get you far higher contrast (56,104:1 and 74,326:1, respectively). The 2021 versions of those TVs, while much brighter, are more expensive.The Omni fares a bit better with color performance, but it doesn’t reach quite far enough. The above charts show color measurements with an SDR signal compared with Rec.709 broadcast standards, and with an HDR signal compared with DCI-P3 digital cinema standards, in Movie mode. The Omni nails Rec.709 out of the box, but this is a less impressive feat than it was a few years ago; many TVs can cover broadcast standard colors accurately with little effort. The HDR signal showed undersaturated greens and reds, falling well short of DCI-P3. Blues were accurate, though, and while other colors were undersaturated, they weren’t skewed or tinted in any way.The Omni’s modest color range comes through in BBC’s Planet Earth II. While all colors look balanced and natural, the greens of plants and feathers appear a bit undersaturated, not showing the vibrancy that the Vizio MQ6-J and more expensive TVs are capable of. Fine details like fur and bark can be clearly seen in all lighting conditions, but shade doesn’t appear particularly dark.Deadpool looks good on the Omni, with the red of Deadpool’s costume appearing nicely balanced in the overcast opening scenes, though again not quite as vibrant as on other TVs we’ve tested. Shadow details in the burning lab fight can appear a bit muddy or washed out depending on how bright the overall frame is.The starkly contrasting shots in the party scenes of The Great Gatsby highlight the Omni’s limitations in brightness and black levels. The cuts and contours of black suits tend to get lost in darkness, and while they can be seen from the overall brightness of the frame, they look a bit washed out. Skin tones appear natural and well balanced, though, and considering the TV’s modest peak brightness, whites still manage to pop out.In terms of features, the Omni is a bit under-equipped for gamers. The 60Hz screen only features auto low latency mode (ALLM), without variable refresh rate (VRR) support. Fortunately, it’s very responsive in Game mode; using an HDFury Diva HDMI matrix, we measured an input lag of only 2.6 milliseconds, making it among the best TVs for gaming (at least in terms of lag; VRR would go far here). Just remember to switch to that mode when you want to play anything, because in Movie mode lag jumps to 111.4ms.Amazon’s first Fire TV offers features galore, but the company clearly isn’t trying to push any boundaries in terms of picture quality. That said, the Fire TV platform is very functional, hands-free Alexa voice control is wonderfully convenient, and $830 for a 65-inch screen makes the Fire TV Omni an appealing choice for the price. If you can afford it, the TCL 4K R6-Series and Hisense U7G both offer far superior contrast and color for a few hundred dollars more. The TCL model uses Roku TV, which offers AirPlay support but lacks a true voice assistant, while the Hisense is powered by Google TV, which features Google Cast and a far-field microphone for hands-free Google Assistant use. If you're looking to spend less and you like Alexa, however, the Fire TV Omni is a good alternative."

7,2,Tom's guide,3.5,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/vizio-v-series-2021-model,,"Vizio's cheapest 4K HDR TV packs in a lot for a low price, but its smart TV is a step behind Roku.Vizio typically stacks its TVs with excellent features for the price and the V-Series, its most-affordable TV with 4K resolution and HDR, fits the mold. New for this year is a Bluetooth voice remote, while gamers and picture tweakers will appreciate its low input lag for gaming and extensive picture adjustments. Its SmartCast smart TV system has a solid selection of built in apps and excellent device compatibility too, but it's still not as good as the rival Roku system. Picture quality on the V-series is fairly average, not better or worse than others in its price range, though that still means a bright, color-accurate image with a decent black level and contrast. I compared its picture to its closest competitor, the TCL 4-Series, and while the V-series was a little dimmer, side-by-side they're virtually indistinguishable.That TCL, which runs on a Roku interface, is a little easier to use and has a more comprehensive selection of streaming services, but not as many adjustments for those who want to fine-tune their TV's image. If you know your way around your TV settings and like dialing in your picture modes, the Vizio is the better option. On the other hand if the price between the two is a wash, I give the TCL a slight edge overall thanks to Roku TV.The 2021 V-Series is available in sizes from 43 to 75 inches and costs between $340 and $920. I reviewed the 55-inch model, which is currently available for around $440.While the V-series lacks the step-up options found on higher-end Vizios like the M- and P-Series -- stuff like next-gen gaming perks, local dimming, wide color gamut or tons of light -- it does have the company's brand new voice remote. That new clicker is one of biggest differences between the V-series and TCL's 4-Series, and Vizio has the advantage. The TCL's remote feels cheap, is IR (infrared) only and lacks voice capability. Meanwhile Vizio's remote feels like it came with a (slightly) more expensive product. It has both IR and Bluetooth, so you only need to point it at the TV when you turn it on. It also has voice control, so you can have the TV change inputs, search for content and more. It doesn't have dedicated playback buttons, unlike the TCL, which is a bit disappointing -- you use the main directional pad to control play/pause, rewind etc.The voice control via the remote works well, about as well as Roku's version on devices that have it (or via a step-up remote). Most useful is being able to search for shows and more. For example, you can hold down the button and say ""Ted Lasso"" and the show will come up with a link to where you can find it. In that case, just Apple TV Plus, but when a show/movie is available on multiple platforms, you can choose the one you want and the TV will navigate directly there with the push of a button. This voice search may seem like a minor thing, but once you get used to it, going back to the old way (like TCL's 4-Series remote) seems archaic.Vizio's remote reserves prime button placement for Vizio's ""free TV"" service which has a hodgepodge of free-to-watch content in a basic-cable kind of way. I suppose more free content is a good thing, but you'll likely press this button by accident way more than you'd ever actually watch this content. Most of the popular streaming services are built-in to Vizio SmartCast, including Netflix, of course, along with Disney Plus, Vudu, Amazon Prime. The TV's interface minimizes their importance, instead drawing your focus to big banners on the top that feature actual shows and movies which seem like ads (which, of course, they are). However, this has the positive effect of making it seem like there's always something available to watch and it changes regularly, unlike the more staid and static Roku interface on the TCL.One service that's notably missing is HBO Max. However, you can install the HBO app on your phone/tablet and cast that to the TV using either Chromecast or Apple AirPlay. That isn't a big deal for the typical tech-savvy CNET reader, but if you're considering this TV for your parents/grandparents and they need their regular fix of The Wire or Oz, this extra step might be frustrating.The rest of Vizio's features and connections are basic as well, with the exception of available Variable Refresh Rate with AMD FreeSync on two 70-inch and 75-inch models -- the V706-J and V756-J -- in the series. The other two V-series TVs in those sizes, the V705-J and V755-J, lack VRR. Gamers who want VRR should note that those step-up""6"" models, like all of the V-series, are still 60Hz TVs -- to get 120Hz input and VRR, you'll need to step up to the P-series.I didn't test those models, but on the 55-inch model I did test, input lag with Game Low Latency mode enabled is low, around 14ms.The Energy Star rating is on the model I reviewed is mid-pack, at $22 per year. For comparison, the 55-inch TCL 4-Series is $12 per year, so not a huge difference.The Vizio leads you through the initial setup steps with big friendly menus. Once you get to the main home screen, there's a lot thrown at you at once. As mentioned above, that does give it a far more dynamic feeling than the basic boring blocks of the Roku interface. One of the main things that separates the Vizio from the TCL are far more extensive picture settings. While the TCL doesn't go much beyond the basics, the Vizio has adjustments for noise reduction settings, resolution/detail enhancements and more. It lets you tweak the image to a degree more typical of a higher-end TV. Like the TCL 4-Series, the Vizio will detect a 24p signal and adjust its refresh and backlight to reduce judder. This is not the soap opera effect. Unlike the TCL, the Vizio gives you the option to turn this off if you notice any issue, or prefer more juddery motion more like a traditional TV.The most direct competitor to the Vizio V-series is TCL's 55S435, which is roughly 10% cheaper at the time I tested it. The Samsung QN55Q60A is that company's entry-level QLED model, though even so it's nearly twice the price of the V-series. It's here to give you an idea what spending more can get you.  For my side-by-side comparison, I connected all three TVs via a Monoprice 1x4 distribution amplifier and viewed them all in a row.The Vizio and TCL looked very, very similar. Though the TCL is a tiny bit brighter, side-by-side you really can't tell that. It's also close enough that's it's likely within the range of standard unit-to-unit variation. Or to put it more simply, overall they're about the same brightness. The TCL's colors are a little more accurate out of the box, but again, they're so close you'd be hard pressed to pick one over the other. Color and brightness are the two things you get stepping up to the Samsung. It's about 15% brighter than the TCL with non-HDR content, which itself is about 10% brighter than the Vizio. So between the Vizio and the Samsung, that's a noticeable difference. Color is more noticeable, however, at least with HDR. With regular HD and 4K content, they're all about the same. With HDR the Samsung has noticeably deeper, richer colors. It also has better brightness with HDR, being able to pump out over 400 nits, nearly double that of the other two. Does that better HDR performance make it worth nearly twice the money? Not in my book. Like nearly all LCDs, off-axis performance isn't great. Which is to say, if you have a wide couch, or grandpa likes to sit in his lounger off to the side, anyone not directly in front of the TV has a noticeably worse image. In this way, however, it's about the same as the TCL and Samsung though. Since the V-series isn't capable of doing much with HDR content, lacking both the brightness and the expanded color capabilities of a ""true"" HDR TV, it's good that does a great job remapping HDR content to be watchable within these limitations. You can dial in how bright the overall image looks and in general it does a better job with this than the TCL. Not a huge difference, but a noticeable one side-by-side. The Vizio V-series and the TCL 4-Series are brothers from other mothers, sisters from other misters. They are far more similar than they are different. The TCL is a little brighter, the Vizio has a little better contrast ratio. In both cases, it's hard to notice even side-by-side. The Roku interface is better and has pretty much every streaming option available. Vizio's remote is better, though, both with its Bluetooth and voice capabilities.Aside from smart TV systems, biggest difference is probably the settings, of which the Vizio has more picture quality adjustment options than the simplistic-by-design TCL. So if you know your way around a TV menu, or want to be able to dial in the picture even on an inexpensive TV, the Vizio is the better choice, as long as you don't mind an extra hoop or two to watch HBO."
8,2,Techradar,3,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/vizio-v-series-2020,The Vizio V-Series offers decent performance at an affordable price,"Its picture performance has a lot of room for improvement, but if you’re after a versatile TV with a load of features in a variety of screen sizes the Vizio V-Series is a nice alternative to more expensive options from Samsung, LG and Sony.The V- in the Vizio V-Series TVs has always stood for ‘value’, but you could easily argue that it should stand for ‘versatile’ instead, as it’s one of the most feature-rich TVs in the budget category. With support for HDR (HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision and HLG) plus Chromecast built-in and AirPlay, the V-Series is a veritable swiss army knife of budget TVs.
Unfortunately, despite all these technologies, the V-Series is still a pretty budget-oriented set and its picture is only fair – contrast isn’t off-the-charts and its color saturation could use some work, too. Its biggest issue is that of awful off-axis viewing (more than 45 degrees) that turns what is a fine and acceptable picture to a really desaturated mess. If you can stay perfectly in front of it, don’t mind less-than-stellar image quality and can deal with a few issues in speed and performance, however, it’s an affordable TV series that packs in a lot of the technology that makes the top TVs from Samsung, LG and Samsung the best in the world.Without a doubt, this pricing structure makes the Vizio V-Series one of the cheapest name-brand TVs on the market - rivaled only by the TCL 4-Series, the Hisense H65 Series and Samsung TU7000, though the latter doesn’t offer HDR, let alone both the HDR10+ and Dolby Vision variants. For the money, we’re still partial to the TCL 4-Series, but if you can spare a bit more it’s probably worth skipping the super-budget market and jumping up to a better mid-range model like the TCL 6-Series (R635) or Hisense H8G Quantum. Despite its modest, mostly plastic exterior the V-Series has a lot going for it in terms of design - some of the models use HDMI 2.1 and full array lighting. These are specs you’d find on much costlier screens so to get them on any budget model is somewhat miraculous.Speaking of ports, Vizio is offering three HDMI ports, one of which is eARC-enabled, and has composite inputs as well. For audio output you’ve got a standard analog audio output as well as a digital audio output plus one USB 2.0 port (1A).Unlike last year’s lineup, there seems to be a bit more consistency to the series this year with the entirety of the series using full array lighting rather than just a few models and that should ensure a more reliable experience regardless of which screen size you pick. What will be different, and this will matter later, is that smaller models don’t have as many local dimming zones as the larger models, but Vizio isn’t listing specifics on its official website.The IR remote, while nicely laid out with hot keys for several key streaming services, is IR-based. What that means is that you won’t be able to use it as a voice remote, making searching for shows just a tad harder than it should be, and you’ll need line of sight to the bottom of the TV which means you’ll need to be careful about soundbar placement.Overall, the Vizio V-Series design for 2020 is functional and unobtrusive, if not meticulously planned out or outright gorgeous.Like other Vizio TVs, the V-Series uses the company’s proprietary SmartCast platform that acts as both a Chromecast built-in system with AirPlay as well as a standard smart platform with apps like Netflix, Hulu and others. The complete lineup of apps on SmartCast currently includes Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Vudu, Apple TV, YouTube, YouTube TV, Xumo, Peacock, CBS All-Access, Fandango and a few music streaming apps like Pandora, Tidal and iHeartRadio. In fact, the only major app missing, as far as we can tell, is HBO Max – which is a bummer but not a deal-breaker.On top of all those apps, SmartCast also has Vizio’s WatchFree app that allows you to stream some content for free with ads. It doesn’t have the absolute best selection of content, but it’s still an invaluable resource for cord-cutters who want live cable-free, and a great alternative to channel surfing for folks who still have a box.For smart home enthusiasts, SmartCast integrates with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant smart speakers, but neither assistant is included on the device itself. The big problems with it, especially on the V-Series, is that it doesn’t always perform well, especially when you first wake the TV up from rest mode. In particular we had problems getting the Chromecast and AirPlay modes to work properly and SmartCast would often hang on an all-grey screen when woken up. The home screen would eventually populate itself with content after about five seconds but, if you didn’t know that would happen, it could feel like the TV was frozen.If you can overlook those hiccups and slower performance speeds, however, SmartCast is a decent, versatile alternative to some 4K streaming media players.When the series is as broad as the V-Series is, it can be hard to make sweeping statements about the whole collection. That being said, thanks to some commonalities across the series like the IQ Active Processor and multi-HDR support, we can paint with a slightly broad stroke first before getting into the specifics of each particular model. The common thread linking the series together is the new IQ Active Processor that’s responsible for upscaling HD to 4K resolution and the V-Gaming Engine that reduces input latency and turns on Game Mode automatically. For the most part, both are pretty great - the upscaling engine used by the V-Series does a great job of turning older HD video into decent 4K, and while it never looks as robust or vibrant as native 4K content, it’s a lot better than comparable 1080p TV pictures.Unfortunately, though, you’re not getting a color-saturated image or one with a load of contrast, especially if you’re sitting off-axis to the TV. From the sides or down below, the TV loses most of its color saturation and contrast goes from OK black levels down to a milky grey. That won’t matter as much if you can stay directly in front of it at all times, but folks with bigger living rooms might struggle to see the same value others might.Similarly, motion is just so-so. It’s a 60Hz VA panel on the 43-inch V435-H11 we picked up from Best Buy for review, and although it has a number of tricks to deal with fast motion sequences but it won’t ever look as good as native 120Hz panels. The limited refresh rates means you won’t be able to hit native 4K / 120Hz with the PS5 or Xbox Series X, but you will likely see rock-steady 4K / 60Hz gameplay when those consoles come out in November.The other minor issue we noticed after using the TV for a few weeks was that the top row of LED backlights began to dim - and that was just after two weeks. The result wasn’t incredibly noticeable if you didn’t know what to look for, but nearly every piece of content we watched from that point on had the slightly dimmer top section. Buy it if you want the lowest priced TV that’s decentIf you simply don’t care about color accuracy or top peak brightness, and you’re OK with a slightly slower smart platform, the V-Series is an incredible value. "
9,2,Digitaltrends,6,https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/vizio-v-series-4k-hdr-tv-review/,Vizio's least expensive TV line leaves something to be desired.,"The V-Series is Vizio’s most affordable TV line, with the 65-inch model coming in at under $500, and the 70-inch model coming in well under $700. That sounds very promising — but what kind of quality can you expect at that price, and is the V-Series competitive with options from the likes of TCL and Hisense?As you would expect with a TV at this price range, setup is fairly simple — screwing in the TV’s plastic feet and removing some protective film is all that’s required for a stand-mounted setup.The TV set itself looks … OK. The V-Series bezels are a bit chunkier than we’re used to seeing, but that not surprising at this basic price range. In fact, “basic” is a word that will come up a lot in this review.The back of the V-Series has composite video inputs, an antenna input, analog and optical audio outputs, and an Ethernet port. On the digital side (and also facing the side of the set) are three HDMI inputs and a USB input. Keep in mind that those HDMI ports are 2.0b and will not support most HDMI 2.1 features. Initially, we didn’t think this TV supported eARC because there was nothing mentioned in the spec sheet, but it turns out one HDMI port does support eARC (more on that later) and is clearly labeled as such.The process of setting up the V-Series takes a while — around 10 minutes. Thankfully, it’s mostly automated, so you can wander off to get more coffee and just let the TV do its thing. After that, you’ll have to agree to some terms and conditions that have to do with informing the sponsored content you will see at the top of the SmartCast home screen, which is where you will land at the end of the setup.The V-Series ships with the picture mode on Vivid, which we moved to Calibrated since that gives us the most accurate picture to start out with. In the Calibrated picture preset, the backlight setting is already maxed out at 100, but most of the other options are set around 50 and can be adjusted to taste. The TV does have full-array local dimming, but it’s a pretty limited system with only 12 zones, so certainly not very advanced. In Advanced Picture Settings, the Backlight Control is switched on, which shows that local dimming control is on by default.The only control available for motion smoothing is Film Mode — there is no other motion menu we could find. Granted, the V-Series is a basic TV, but it would be nice to have at least some control over motion settings. It’s possible that when a different picture mode like Sports is selected, the motion smoothing automatically adjusts for that content, but the lack of any other controls left us wanting.As we mentioned, there is no external label for eARC support on the back of the TV. However, we discovered that there is an option to turn eARC on or off under the Audio menu. We would suggest an inexpensive soundbar for the V-Series as its built-in audio isn’t very good.It’s also worth noting that the V-Series ships with DTS: Virtual X surround sound turned on, which we disabled since it seemed to add a washed-out quality to the sound.After running several test patterns and switching between standard dynamic range (SDR) and high dynamic range (HDR), there didn’t appear to be much of a difference between the two formats. The V-Series does come with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG, but the set just isn’t bright enough to have that make a difference in the picture quality — according to Vizio, the screen maxes out at 400 nits.As far as overall picture quality goes, it’s not particularly special. Bright highlights tend to be a bit washed out, and color also appeared to be a little aggressive. That’s forgivable for a budget option and, once again, the word “basic” applies. But if you’re looking for a standout picture experience, stepping up to the Vizio M-Series would be a better choice at around $220 more for the 65-inch model and a more modest upgrade of about $90 for the 55-inch model.We should also note the screen had some vignetting in the corners and odd bright spots down the sides. Maybe that’s a “screen lottery” thing, maybe that’s a quality control thing, or perhaps it’s a damage in transit issue. If we had purchased this TV, we would certainly look for an exchange if we decided to keep it.Vizio advertises the V-Series as having a pro gaming engine, but it looks like the only real options are Game Low Latency (which switches the TV to its lowest input lag settings) and Game HDR. And while it did automatically recognize our Xbox Series X, it switched the picture mode to Bright instead of Game, which we had to manually select. You can also toggle the Backlight Control (the full-array dimming feature) as well, presumably to help reduce lag.But as far as gaming features go, that’s about it. Even with HDR gaming, the V-Series isn’t quite bright enough to have HDR gaming appear to make any discernible difference.When it comes down to it, the V-Series is designed to be used right out of the box by people who simply want to have a big screen and don’t care about the specifics. The perfect use case would be putting it in the garage or man cave or game room — somewhere that you just want a big screen for occasional movies or games, and something you don’t have to fuss with or gawk over. If what you want is a lot of screen real estate for a low price — and that’s about it — then the V-Series is worth checking out.Is there a better alternative?Yes, the Vizio M-Series would be a better buy for picture quality; however, the V-Series does manage to edge out the comparably priced TCL 4-Series.How long will it last?With Vizio’s latest SmartCast system and record of long-term performance in TVs, the V-Series should last several years.Warranty: Vizio provides a one-year warranty on its TV products. More information can be found on Vizio’s warranty page.Should you buy it?Outside of those looking for the most screen for the least money, no. Again, we would suggest looking at the much better-performing Vizio M-Series.

10,2,Techhive,3.5,https://www.techhive.com/article/579087/vizio-v-series-tv-review.html,"This TV offers better processing than the recently reviewed Konka, though it lacks its rival's Bluetooth capabilities. It also shows how better technology has drifted down the chain.","You won’t go far wrong with this budget TV from Vizio. For the price the picture is very good, although the colors aren’t particularly accurate and there’s no motion compensation. With most material, you won’t have any complaints.Vizio’s V-series smart TV (the $300, 50-inch model V505-H19 is reviewed here) is the second 50-inch TV I’ve evaluated recently, the other being the slightly cheaper ($280) Konka U50.Both are infinitely superior to anything you could’ve found in this price range five years ago. That said, the Vizio provides a bit better processing, backlighting, overall image and experience. But it lacks the Konka’s handy Bluetooth connectivity. This review is part of TechHive’s coverage of the best smart TVs, where you’ll find reviews of the competition’s offerings, plus a buyer’s guide to the features you should consider when shopping for this type of product.The V505-H19 is a thin-bezel unit whose staid, but classy appearance belies its low price. The 50-inch-class panel delivers 10-bit color, a 60Hz refresh rate, and 3840 x 2160 (4K UHD) resolution. It has a full-array LED backlight, so it is not zone dimmable. That means it’s lit from behind with multiple lights, but the lights aren’t dimmed or shut off to decrease light bleed.The V505-H19 is very light for a 50-inch TV at a mere 21.5 pounds. I had no issues slinging the TV around to put the feet on, sliding it around to reach the cable connections, and so on.  That also means there will be little strain on the 200mm x 200mm VESA mount point, the mount, or your wall. Vizio knows that there’s lots of legacy equipment in this market segment, so the port selection includes composite video input and RCA analog audio input/output. There’s also optical digital (Toslink), coax for cable/satellite TV or an over-the-air antenna, as well as three HDMI 2.1 ports (2160p @ 60Hz, with one supporting ARC output). A USB port is on hand for playback from mass media (thumb drives, etc.).There’s no Bluetooth, but the Wi-Fi is dual-band 802.11n, which is easily fast enough for streaming most content. If it isn’t, there’s also an ethernet port. Props to Vizio for including support for HDR10+ in addition to Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG. Not all TVs do that, and not just TVs at this price. The TV also handles DTS surround and Dolby Atmos, offers a low-latency game mode, and supports both Apple AirPlay 2 and Chromecast. The TV is also compliant with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice control. Content-wise, Vizio’s SmartCast Home is as complete as TV user interfaces come, with all the usual streaming providers, as well as curated free content. SmartCast is also easy to use, and can be controlled using the SmartCast app on your smartphone or tablet if you so desire. My only complaint, a distinctly minor one in this day and age, is that it’s completely reliant upon an internet connection and does not when if your broadband connection is down. You can still use the TV, but with limited functionality.On the other hand, a repeat quick shoutout (I also noted this in the Vizio OLED review) to the company for fixing the Media Player app. It’s still a plain DOS-like file browser, but now it’s responsive, plays all the media I throw at it, and doesn’t crash.The remote is simple and easy to use, though I would’ve appreciated dedicated transport controls to make media playback a bit easier. Still, it fits in the hand nicely and is large enough to not disappear forever between the couch cushions. I don’t talk to TVs outside of testing, but the remote’s lack of a mic might bother some. Hey, what can I say? It’s entry-level, and you can use the SmartCast phone app for that purpose, as well as the other supported protocols (Siri, etc.). As I said in the intro, the V505-H19 reminds me quite a bit of the 50-inch Konka U5-series I just reviewed. It’s a dead ringer as far as the slight blue color skew and backlighting are concerned; however, it suffers a bit less moiré, shimmer, and other artifacts when processing detailed areas in motion.The V505-H19 offers a bit more color saturation, but because of the heavy blue content of the backlight/filter technology, reds skew slightly orange; greens, slightly lime. Very slightly, I should say. Many users might not even notice. Again, same as the Konka.Also, forget the advertising about Dynamic Motion Rate 120. If you read the description carefully, nowhere does it say smooth action or no judder. There’s no motion compensation of any kind—same as with the Konka. That said, within its 60Hz/no compensation limits, it’s better than some I’ve seen. And scenes that produce the judder effect, fast pans and large items moving rapidly across screen, are relatively rare.While the V505-H19 supports the most popular HDR formats, it doesn’t really have the contrast to do a lot with them. Blacks are slightly better than with the Konka, but it’s still array backlighting with no local dimming. We’re talking charcoal gray more than black. Basically, it handles HDR, but doesn’t lend it the drama that technology can convey with higher-contrast—and more expensive—TVs. When it comes to sound, the V505-H19 is okay for casual, occasional, listening, but I found it annoyingly muddy. If I were you, I’d hook up something more sonorous in short order. Note that after a firmware update, the sound disappeared and didn’t reappear until I switched to the free curated content. If you experience the same phenomenon, that’s the trick. The omission of Bluetooth isn’t unexpected at this price point, as it was with the company’s far more expensive OLED, the absence of Bluetooth support does slightly aggravate the weak sound issue. If you want to listen privately on headphones, you’ll need to purchase a separate Bluetooth transmitter ($30 and up) or make other arrangements, although you can use your phone and the SmartCast app to listen using headphones. That’s not an ideal solution in my book. The V505-H19 is an excellent entry-level TV with a slightly better overall image than the Konka I’ve been comparing it to. If you’re comparing it to higher-end 50-inchers, revise excellent to decent.Still, entry-level is the not the painful, bereft-of-color viewing experience it was just a few short years ago. Indeed, the $300 V505-H19 compares favorably with $1,500 sets in our first roundup in 2015."
11,3,Rtings,5.9,https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/3-series-2019,,"The TCL 3 Series S325 is an entry-level 1080p LED TV with mediocre picture quality.

12,3,Tom's guide,3,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/tcl-3-series-roku-tv-32s335,An above average HD TV with Roku smarts,"The 32-inch TCL 3-Series Roku TV (32S335) proves that there's a place for small, inexpensive TVs, especially those places where a larger set might not fit. Just as you can't use a Corvette to shuttle a gaggle of kids home from a little league game, you also can't always use a 75-inch Ultra 4K TV just to follow a Rachel Ray recipe. How would you fit it in your kitchen and where would you do your prep work? Fortunately, for those situations there are still some inexpensive 32-inch HD TVs like the TCL 3-Series Roku TV (32S335) that fit the bill. Intended for places where a 75-inch or even 55-inch set is impractical–or just plain ridiculous–TCL's 32-inch 3-Series LCD TV is for casual viewing environments: kitchens, home offices, RVs, even dorm rooms. It doesn't support the latest 4K resolutions or handle the brighter, more intense colors offered by high dynamic range (HDR) content. But what it does offer is a solid 720p HD picture, in a size that will fit on a countertop or office desk, all for a reasonable price. With a recommended price of just $199, the TCL 3-Series Roku is the earliest entry point for the company's extensive line of TVs that extend all the way up to premium big-screen models that sell for thousands. If you want something different, but still want to stick to the $199 price, there's also the TCL 3-Series 32S330, which has the same price, size and resolution, but uses Android TV instead of Roku's smart TV software. Also available is a full-HD 1080p version of the 3-Series – the TCL 3-Series Roku TV (32S327) –  that sells for $219, just $20 more than the model in this review. If you're interested in getting a full 4K set instead, take a look at our TCL 4-Series Roku TV (S435) review. At $349, it's a significant price jump, but it gets you a bigger picture (assuming you have the space) and the ability to take full advantage of 4K streaming content. For perching the set on a countertop there are two small, v-shaped plastic feet at either end of the TCL 3-Series set. It's a stable arrangement and the set looks lighter and less dominant than other black plastic sets. That's because its feet are thinner than most and the screen's surrounding bezel is relatively svelte for this type of TV, less than half an inch wide around the top and sides (although the bottom portion is still roughly three quarters of an inch). If you're planning to mount this model over a desk or even a sink, it accommodates a standard 100 x 100 millimeter VESA mount, including most of the selections on our best TV mounts list. The mounting hardware costs as little as $20. A square, distended module on the back right-hand side of the set houses all the necessary connections. The TCL 3-Series has 3 HDMI ports, one of which is audio return channel (ARC) compatible for automatically synching with an ARC soundbar or receiver. Also here you'll find the necessary composite audio/video input for hooking up an old VCR, and a headphone jack for plugging in a pair of headphones for quiet viewing. To make the requisite connection to your home network, the 3-Series has built-in 802.11ac Wi-Fi, but is lacking a wired Ethernet port. Selecting just the right Goldilocks picture setting on the TCL 3-Series is a little tricky. Because it's not a terribly bright display, there is a temptation to choose the set's ""Brighter"" or ""Bright"" preset. However, to keep some more subtle picture elements visible — and not give faces on screen an unnatural hue — we choose the set's ""Dark"" preset and the ""Movie"" picture mode for our viewing tests. We should note from the start that if you're accustomed to 4K TVs, you'll notice the lack of image sharpness in the TCL 3-Series' picture. Simply read any graphic text at the bottom of a screen or the scrolling credits after a movie and you'll see what we mean. The 720p has a fuzziness that 4K images lack. On the other hand, if you're primarily playing streaming YouTube videos and similar content, the TCL 3-Series' resolution is fine and in many cases with older video it produced a clearer picture by foregoing the pixelation caused by upscaling on 4K sets. For a kids room, the TCL 3-Series handled material like Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales in HD with skill. The fleshtones of the sailors and the earnest Will Turner were realistically rendered and the bright red of the British coats were sufficiently saturated without bleeding into the surrounding scene. Conversely, there were some obvious deficiencies in the darker scenes aboard the Dutchman where there was some loss of detail in shadowy images and corners. That lack of dynamic range in terms of brightness and contrast was also apparent in other programs. The early picnic scene in Avengers Endgame, for example, was more washed out than usual and the farm looked as if it were suffering from a serious drought. We also couldn't help but notice the banding and halo artifacts that appeared around the bright glow of objects like lightsabers. Nevertheless, the 32-inch TCL 3-Series did well enough for a set in this price range. With the traditional Rec 709 color spectrum it reproduced 98.28% of the standard color gamut. That's not up to the near 100 percent results from bargain 4K sets, such as those seen in our Vizio V-Series (2020 model) review or TCL's own 43-inch 4-Series Roku TV (43S435), but it is significantly better than what we saw from another budget 32-inch budget HD set, the Insignia Fire TV Edition NS-32DF310NA19. That set only managed to reproduce 86.95% of the standard color gamut. Color fidelity was another area where the TCL 3-Series certainly did well enough. While a score of 2 or less is considered a solid result, the TCL 3-Series we tested turned in a Delta E of 2.17, not far from what we'd expect from much more expensive sets. The similarly priced 32-inch Insignia F20 Fire TV Edition had a Delta-E score of  7.65, a disappointing result that was visible in our viewing tests. If there was one noticeable shortcoming with the TCL 3-Series it was in the area of brightness. It turned in 207.86 nits in our 10 percent pattern test. Most sets manage a significantly brighter image, such as the Vizio V-Series with 299.67 nits. So The TCL 3-Series won't be the brightest in, say, a kitchen setting; even the Insignia F20 Fire TV Edition 32-inch bested it with 235.92 nits in the same test. The TCL 3-Series offers several preset audio modes: normal, speech (which was almost painful to listen to), music, theater, big bass, and high treble. Most are self-explanatory and we favored the music and theater modes as being the most fulsome sound settings. Challenging the set with a series of overproduced pop songs, the TCL 3-Series didn't particularly distinguish itself. With high, soaring vocals, the top end was thin and tinny and there were virtually no lower notes. Bass kick drums were turned into bongo drums on this TV's built-in sound system. Using the big bass mode didn't help; it merely suppressed the high-notes in an attempt to create the illusion that it was playing lower notes (it was not). Such sonic limitations extended to movies, as well, where Star Wars’ C3PO sounded as if he had a cold. The TCL 3-Series' downward firing built-in speakers will produce enough sound pressure to fill an office or kitchen with music (unless you have a Xanadu-sized office or kitchen). Oddly, once you pass the three quarters mark on the volume display (about 75), it doesn't actually get any louder no matter how high you turn it up. We're not shy about pointing out which software is the easiest and simplest when it comes to juggling multiple programming sources: It's Roku. And so it makes perfect sense to use it as the software foundation for TCL's 3-Series, which is meant to be a simple, straightforward TV. The easy-to-follow setup routine is relatively painless, and there's even an introductory video for neophytes on the set's features and options. Once you've entered your home's Wi-Fi information, you're basically all set. Roku has arguably the widest array of supported streaming services and sources, from the Criterion Channel to Netflix, Acorn to Spectrum. So if you're looking for a simple setup, you should have everything you need in the TCL 3-Series without having to add a separate box. TCL includes the basic Roku remote with the 3-Series set. It has a four-way directional pad for navigating through menus and dedicated buttons for the likes of Netflix, Disney+ and Hulu. The volume controls are on the right side next to a mute button. There is no microphone built into the basic remote, so you cannot do direct voice searches for, say, Sally Field movies or dark Danish detective shows. There is a Roku app for smartphones, however, that offers voice search for the TV, or you can replace your Roku TV remote with a model that has voice capabilities built in. And if you have a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa smart speaker you can download the TCL skills for it for basic voice control. If you're looking for a basic smaller TV for a kitchen or an RV, the TCL 3-Series is a better choice compared to other HD TVs in this price range. The quality of the 720p display and the superior Roku TV interface make it a great choice among similarly cheap small TVs. Similarly, the TCL 3-Series is $50 more than the 32-inch Insignia F20 Fire TV Edition but offers a much better picture for the money. All told, the TCL 3-Series Roku TV (32S335) is the best of its kind, making it the sub-$200 smart TV to get."
13,3,CNET,7,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/tcl-32s325-roku-tv-review/,"Want a small, cheap streaming TV? Start here","The trend in TVs today is bigger and bigger screen sizes, and I'm the first reviewer to tell you get a larger TV. For years my TV buying guide has included the following line: ""Bigger is better: More than any other 'feature,' stepping up in TV screen size is the best use of your money."" But what if money is tight? What if you can't fit a 55-inch TV in that spot? What if a 32- or 40-inch TV -- positively puny by today's standards -- is plenty? If that's the case for you, start with the TCL S325 series, reviewed here along with its larger brother the S425. Let's get one thing out of the way first: Their picture quality is mediocre. They can't compete with more expensive sets for black-level performance, contrast or pop. If you want a home theater-worthy image in a budget set, start with the Vizio E-Series. Unfortunately, it's not available in sizes under 43 inches. Put another way: Don't expect great image quality in any TV under 43 inches. On the other hand, mediocre might be good enough for you, especially if you're buying a smaller set for secondary viewing or you just want the cheapest smart TV you can get. As long as you don't expect too much, you might be perfectly satisfied with a TCL 3- or 4-Series, especially for the price. And if nothing else, I predict you'll like its built-in Roku. Even though the oldest TVs are from 2017, TCL told CNET that the only difference between them and the 2018/2019 models is in cosmetic design. They have the same picture quality and features. (These models are not available in the UK and Australia.)
We've reviewed the S305 and S405 in 2017 and for this review we compared them with two new 2019 review samples, the 43-inch 43S325 and the 50-inch 50S425. Yes, the cosmetics are slightly different, with the newer sets having black stand legs instead of silver, and slightly different frames around the picture. We also saw some minor differences in image quality (see below for details). But overall not much has changed in two years, and the CNET ratings are the same for all of them. In other words, you're fine buying the 2017 (S305 and S405) versions for as long as they remain on the market. TCL's representative said they'd be slowly phased out and replaced by the newer models (S325 and S425) this year. Here's where I mention that the S305 and S325 models have 720p in the 32-inch size, and 1080p resolution (aka full HD) in the 40- and 43-inch sizes, and they can't do high dynamic range (HDR). Meanwhile the S405 and S425 models have 4K resolution and HDR capability. As you can see on the chart, for most sizes there's no overlap: The 32- and 40-inch sizes are HD only, while the 50-, 55- and 65-inch sizes are 4K HDR only. Most people choose a TV size first, then worry about everything else, so there's not much of a choice in those sizes. Where sizes overlap (43- and 49-inch) there's typically a $30 to $70 difference. For most buyers in this price range, I don't think it's worth paying that difference. You're better off saving the money and getting the 1080p, HD, non-HDR versions instead of the 4K HDR versions. Yes, you could see some improvement in image quality with some 4K HDR material, but it will be minor at best. See the image quality section below for more. The best thing about the 3- and 4-Series TVs is built-in Roku. It gives you dead-simple access to just about every streaming app available, including Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Sling TV, Pluto TV and more. Since the apps are built in, you can get to them faster and more easily than via an external streamer, which requires switching inputs and probably juggling a second remote. Of course you can connect other gear (like game consoles or Blu-ray players) to these Roku TVs too, and they have some cool features for people who use an over-the-air antenna to get free TV. Roku TV's main competitor is Amazon's Fire TV Edition sets by Toshiba and Insignia. Amazon has its advantages, especially when it comes to voice control with Alexa. But I still like the Roku platform better overall because its menu system is more neutral -- it doesn't force-feed you Amazon Prime TV shows and movies. As usual with Roku devices, navigating the menus was quick and responsive and apps loaded quickly. The exceptions came when I encountered a ""loading"" screen, which typically occurred with less frequently used apps or during first launch. At times it could take a while -- Amazon Prime video took around 10 seconds to load at first -- but after that initial load, the app would typically launch in a second or two. Overall Roku still provides one of the snappiest, easiest-to-use streaming experiences around. As I mentioned at the start, don't expect any of these TCLs to perform like champs, but do expect to feel satisfied for the price. For this review I compared the 2019 TCL 50S425 and 43S325 side by side with two 2017 TCL 4-Series sets -- the 55S405 and the 43S305 -- as well as with the 65-inch Vizio E-Series. I didn't put them through my usual TV review process and measurements, but I did some basic measurements, and saw enough to convince me the TCLs are still ""good enough."" None was as good as the Vizio, however. Comparing black levels in the dark parts of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 and Black Panther, the Vizio showed a clear advantage, with deeper, more realistic letterbox bars and shadows. The difference was also obvious in brighter scenes, where the improved contrast of the letterbox bars and richer colors paid dividends and the Vizio showed much superior pop.Between the two larger TCLs, the newer, 50-inch version looked better, with deeper black levels and more saturated, accurate color. The difference wasn't overwhelming, however, and the Vizio still looked quite a bit better than the 50-inch TCL. There was little visible difference between the two 43-inch TCL models. Light output on the TCLs was mediocre, as you'd expect from a cheaper TV, and in the least accurate settings the Vizio E was brighter. But in the accurate settings I'd recommend -- Movie/Brighter for the TCLs and Calibrated for the Vizio E -- the TCLs outshine the the Vizio significantly, 272 nits (on the 50S425) to 186 (on the Vizio in Medium local dimming). Screen uniformity wasn't great, with test patterns showing brighter areas and backlight structure on all of the TCL samples at various brightness levels. The Vizio was much better in comparison. As I've seen from many inexpensive TVs, the Rokus didn't introduce much input lag for gamers. The S325's Game mode measured a healthy 26ms (1080p), while the 50S425's measured 31ms (1080p) and 29ms (4K HDR). These are all 60Hz TVs despite TCL's fake ""120Hz CMI effective refresh rate"" specification, and tests indicated as much: They delivered only 300 lines of motion resolution and there's no smoothing or soap opera effect option. Like many HDR TVs that lack local dimming, the TCL S425 showed little advantage displaying 4K HDR content instead of standard HD SDR. I watched Altered Carbon from Netflix, which has some of the most impressive HDR effects I've seen, in both 1080p SDR and 4K HDR, swapping back and forth. On the S425 and S405 the differences were subtle enough that I would have a tough time telling them apart. Performing the same comparison on the Vizio, the advantage of HDR was a bit more apparent, with somewhat more dimension and pop to the image (thanks mostly to better black level) and slightly better color. Overall HDR looked better on the Vizio than on the TCL, but the advantage wasn't as great as with SDR. It's no surprise that brighter sets with more local dimming zones, like Vizio's M-Series or TCL's 6-Series, do a much better job showcasing HDR than either the TCL 4 or the Vizio E."
14,3,Techhive,4,https://www.techhive.com/article/584183/tcl-3-series-roku-tv-review.html,"You won't find a small TV with better smart and streaming features than Roku-based TCL's 32S325. Its 720p picture is very good, and the price is right.","Anyone looking for a smaller, less-expensive TV for the kitchen, bedroom, or another room in the house where a big screen just won’t fit should take a look at this 32-incher from TCL (TCL model number 32S325). It delivers only 720p resolution, but it provides all the Roku smart TV features and streaming bells and whistles that TCL’s larger sets offer, and the picture is very good considering it’s based on older technology. Perhaps more importantly, as I was writing this, Amazon was selling it for for less than $130. As noted, the TCL 32S325 is a 32-inch TV sold as 720p, but its actual resolution is 1366 x 768, rather than 1280 x 720; but the aspect ratio is still 16:9, so it scales evenly. It’s light as a feather at less than 9 pounds, and it has a 100mm x 100mm VESA mount point. The bezel is thinner, and the overall look better than I had expected. TVs of this size and price point often look cheap—this one does not. The port selection on the TCL 32S325 is far more generous than I expected for the price. There are three HDMI ports (1.4a, one supporting the Audio Return Channel), headphone and coax jacks, optical audio out, 3.5mm A/V (composite video and analog stereo audio), and even a USB port. There’s 802.11n Wi-Fi, but no Bluetooth so you can’t use commonly available Bluetooth speakers and headsets. It is compatible, however, with wireless Roku speakers. You could also use the headphone/aux out to feed a discrete Bluetooth broadcast module. There’s no mistaking the market segment when you attach the 32S325’s feet. Even marginally more expensive TVs use bolts, the 32S325’s uses screws that go into non-threaded plastic holes. But the TV is so light this makes little difference. Also, the bottom of the TV is deep and flat enough that it will stand up without the feet, though it being so light, I would use double-sided tape or some other method to secure it if I were to go that route. The Roku TV interface one of the simplest and easiest to use in the business. The homepage is configurable, it will automatically sense attached devices, and the settings are easy to get to. Streaming aficionados will certainly like it as there’s a mountain of easily searchable content, including all the most popular channels and services. I was also impressed by how agile the interface felt overall, with little to no lag navigating between sections. The TCL 32S325 also features an honest- to-goodness native media app that will play photos, video, and music from a USB drive. It doesn’t, however, support HEVC (h.265) or streaming from DLNA servers. For media streaming across your home network, you’ll need to install Plex from the “channels” list. I’d much prefer VLC, which is better than both DLNA and Plex in terms of format support, and doesn’t require an account or installing a server. Alas, it’s not currently available for Roku. To use the streaming features and register the TV as a Roku device, you need to create an account and sign in to the Roku website. In fact, the TCL 32S325 wouldn’t let me log on to a local network unless it featured an internet connection. If you’re not into that kind of thing, don’t bother with Roku. The Roku remote, despite the somewhat cheap feel and appearance, is a favorite. Like the Roku interface, it’s simple, to the point, and has a synergy with said interface that’s lacking in many TVs. Only Samsung really comes close in that regard. I also very much appreciate the transport buttons (play/pause, forward, back) that so many simpler remotes lack. There are also Netflix, Hulu, Roku, and ESPN shortcut buttons. Before I get into the image details; watching 1080p and 720p movies on TCL’s 32S325 was a lot nicer experience than I thought it would be. There’s obviously going to be less detail than with native 1080p, but it struck me that DVD was the big leap from earlier standards. Subsequent jumps in resolution, while nice, are just icing on the cake. That opinion is open to argument. Regardless, the TCL 32S325’s picture is middling in the grand scheme of things. It’s edge-lit without a lot of fancy zones, so its blacks lean toward gray. This effect is minimal if you view the TV at a 90-degree angle, but it becomes more noticeable if you move off-axis. The image doesn’t disappear, but the contrast drops significantly. Color is slightly blue-skewed (cool) due to the white LED backlighting, though not as much as TVs from just a few years ago. Detail is quite good up to DVD quality and the motion is decent for a 60Hz panel, although I did notice some stutter here and there. There aren’t a lot of artifacts either—another benefit of the lower resolution with its lesser processing needs. Sound is what I’d call adequate, without a lot of bass, but clear and loud enough for casual use. I actually like the sound better than what was emanating from a 55-inch Hisense sitting right behind it. Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Plus are both supported, but I highly suggest you use the ARC output to something beefier if your interested in sound of that quality. All in all, the TCL 32S325 delivers a good picture within the limits of the slightly older technologies involved. The competition at the price suffer the same issues, and quite often to a more severe degree. The TCL 32S325 offers all the smarts and streaming features that today’s viewers are increasingly embracing. The picture isn’t for Blu-ray junkies, but it’s certainly good enough for DVD quality, and I was struck by how much better normal broadcasts looked at their native (almost) resolution. I missed Bluetooth for my headphones, but otherwise thoroughly enjoyed my time with it."
15,3,Forbes,3,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2019/06/19/tcl-3-series-s325-review-an-entry-level-1080p-tv-with-mediocre-picture-quality/?sh=6c34def541cc,The TCL 3 Series S325 is an entry-level 1080p LED TV that delivers mediocre picture quality.,"The TCL 3 Series S325 is an entry-level 1080p LED TV that delivers mediocre picture quality. It’s more suitable for an average-lit or a dim room, as it can't get bright enough to fight glare. In a dark room, the S325 delivers deep blacks thanks to its very good native contrast ratio, but doesn’t have a local dimming feature to further improve performance. Unfortunately, there is no HDR support and the TV can only display SDR content. The image in SDR is very accurate, which is great since the TV doesn’t allow for any calibration. The viewing angles, on the other hand, are mediocre, and the gray uniformity isn’t much better either. On the upside, the TCL S325 has a fast response time, great for watching sports, and a very low input lag, good even for the most demanding gamers. Finally, the TCL S325 has the full Roku TV smart platform which, however, doesn't run very smoothly. The design of the TCL 3 Series S325 is decent. It has a wide stand that’s almost as wide as the TV, and for larger model sizes you’ll need a larger table to place it on. The stand is plastic and supports the TV well but can’t prevent wobbling if you accidentally nudge the TV. The back is similar to its sister, the TCL 4 Series S425, and looks as if it’s made of two distinct parts. The lower part, which houses the electronics, is made of plastic and is a little thicker, whereas the upper part is made of metal and is thinner. Overall, the TV is of average thickness and will not protrude much if you wall-mount it. Unfortunately, there is no planning for cable management, but the build quality is decent and should not cause you any issues. The TCL 3 Series S325 has mediocre picture quality. As an entry-level TV, it doesn’t support HDR and lacks many of the more advanced modern TV features. Although it has a contrast ratio of 3426:1 and can display deep blacks in a dark room, it doesn’t have a local dimming feature to make the image look better. It has a remarkably accurate SDR image, but its brightness is only 174cm/m2, so you can’t place it in a bright room as it won’t fight glare. The gray uniformity is mediocre and there is evident dirty screen effect that will disappoint sports fans. The image loses accuracy at small angles when you look from the side, but on the upside reflection handling is great, and it’s unlikely that you'll be distracted by the presence of lights in the room. Upscaling of DVD and cable content is good, but the TV has a 1080p native resolution and won’t natively display 4k content. Some people might be bothered by the noticeable 8-bit banding in most shades and colors, but on the upside, there are no signs of temporary image retention, as expected from a VA panel. The motion handling of the TCL S325 is decent. The S325 is an entry-level TV that doesn’t have any advanced motion handling features like motion interpolation or FreeSync support. The TV uses PWM to dim the backlight, but only for brightness levels lower than 31/100. At these lower brightness levels, the introduction of flicker works as a black frame insertion feature and helps the image look crisper, but the flicker frequency of 180Hz might be bothersome to some people. The response time is fast but not as fast as most modern TVs, so the transition from one frame to the next is not instant and there is some blur that makes motion look smooth. This is good for movies as they don’t have much stutter, but unfortunately, only 24p signal movies, like from a DVD or a Blu-ray, are judder free. Movies played over 60Hz signals or even from the native apps are not judder free. The input lag of the TCL S325 is very low. The 12.1ms we measured is one of the lowest input lag measurements we’ve had so far. To obtain it you must enable ‘Game’ mode. Unfortunately, the TV's highest resolution is 1080p @ 60Hz. On the bright side, the S325 displays crisp text when used as a PC monitor, as it supports proper chroma 4:4:4 when it detects that it's connected to a PC. The TCL 3 Series S325 has a poor sound quality. The TV can get reasonably loud but creates a lot of distortion at higher volumes. It practically can’t produce any bass, but dialog is intelligible and clear. The TCL S325 runs the same Roku TV smart interface that the higher-end TCL models run. Although it has almost the same features, it doesn’t run as smoothly as it runs on the higher-end models. The interface is intuitive and easy to use. It has a large number of ‘Streaming Channels,’ which is the name Roku uses for the TV's apps, and it's likely that you'll find what you want. Unfortunately, navigation within the apps is laggy and can hang for a few seconds before it responds to your action. On the upside, the interface allows you to cast from your phone or play from a USB. The TV has a very basic remote and does not support voice control. Unfortunately, like most modern TVs, the S325 has ads in its interface. You can only opt out of personalized ads, which might bother some people. The TCL S325 is an entry-level TV. It serves better as a secondary TV for a kitchen or garage where the picture quality is not of primary concern. As a 1080p TV, it's more appropriate for watching TV shows or sports from cable or the native apps. The Roku interface makes sure that you'll find what want among its numerous ‘Streaming Channels.’ Unfortunately, even though you'll find all the available movie apps, the TV's movie performance is sub-par, due to the lack of local dimming and the not-so-uniform blacks. Also, the S325 doesn’t support HDR content and can’t play movies free from judder from its native apps or from a cable box. Thanks to its low input lag, the TV performs well in gaming but lacks any of the more advanced features that usually attracts gamers. Finally, it's a decent TV if you plan to use it as a PC monitor."
16,4,CNET,7.1,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/tcl-43s435-review/,The TCL S435 performs better than you'd think for the price.,"The TCL 4-Series is so inexpensive and capable you might start to question why there are any multithousand-dollar TVs at all. If you're just looking for an easy-to-use TV with decent picture, this is an excellent place to start. It's ridiculously affordable, offers 4K resolution in a wide range of sizes and has the same excellent Roku interface as that company's megapopular streaming devices. The downside is that the picture quality is fairly average, especially if you compare it to TVs that cost more. The remote -- that is, the thing you'll interact with most -- is a bit of a letdown. And its HDR image isn't appreciably better than non-HDR, for reasons I'll cover below.In both price and picture quality, one of its closest competitors is the Vizio V555-J. Their images looked very similar in my comparison, and while the Vizio offers more settings to help dial in the best quality and includes a voice remote, the TCL is easier to use and better for streaming.However, despite its image quality issues you really can't overlook that price. The 55-inch I reviewed retails for just $400, and the other sizes are similarly affordable -- new for 2021, the 4-Series is available all the way up to 85 inches. It's simple, looks good and makes perfect sense if you don't need the bells and whistles found on expensive TVs.The S435 is a basic 4K TV -- no fancy extras here like next-gen gaming perks, local dimming, wide color gamut or tons of light. Its best feature, Roku's smart TV interface, is CNET's favorite, with large icons for both streaming services and the television's various inputs. If you're buying this TV because you've used Roku in the past, you'll be right at home here. Its marriage of television and streamer frees up the number of devices you need to plug in.The only major difference between this and a Roku streaming device like the Roku Express 4K Plus is the remote itself. Myself, I've used a Roku media streamer for years and have found the small pill-shaped remotes work great. TCL's version looks similar, but feels far cheaper and depends on infrared signals -- so you'll need to remember to aim it at the TV. Once you get used to how easy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth remotes are (point anywhere!), IR feels like a step back. The hard plastic buttons also feel cheap and make a cheap-sounding click. It's one of the few things that reminds you that this is a budget TV. You can also use Roku's mobile app for iOS or Android, which at the very least makes putting in your various logins and passwords easier. The app also has voice search, something the TCL remote doesn't. This lets you just say something like ""Tacoma FD"" and it finds all the places you can stream/buy a show or movie. It's fast: Once you get used to it, you'll wonder why all streaming platforms don't work that way. By the way, you can purchase Roku's $30 Voice Remote Pro if you really miss that voice remote aspect, which brings the price more or less in line with the Vizio V555. The Vizio V555 already has a Bluetooth remote with voice control. However, its user interface isn't quite as friendly as Roku's one, and it doesn't have access to as many streaming services. Notably, the V555 doesn't have HBO Max yet, though you can stream that service from your phone.If you send the TCL 24 frames per second content, like from a Blu-ray or movies and most shows on streaming, it will switch to 48 hertz. This eliminates the 3:2 judder so any motion in the image is smoother and more natural-looking. This isn't the soap opera effect, which is even smoother but less natural looking. The 4-Series doesn't have SOE, and like most budget TVs it has a 60-hertz refresh rate, not 120-hertz.The 55-inch gets an Energy Star rating of $12, which is on the low (good) end compared to similar TVs. Connectivity is ample for a budget TV. There are four HDMI inputs, and one of them has ARC (though not the newer eARC). If you don't have a fancy soundbar with an ARC input, you can get the audio out of the TV via a 3.5mm headphone jack or optical cable. The 4-Series setup is intuitive and easy. You'll need a Roku account if you don't have one already, then you can pick a few channels based on what streaming services you subscribe to. If you already have a Roku account, much of this will be done for you. And what a bevy of channels you have to choose from. Basically, if there's a streaming service it's probably available on Roku (well, usually, or at least eventually). So that means Netflix, of course, along with HBO Max, Disney Plus, Vudu, Amazon Prime and just about anything else you can think of. There are also those four HDMI inputs on the back -- so if you want to connect a game console, or multiple game consoles, plus a cable box and something else, you've got the connections. The lack of an ""input"" button on the remote does feel a little weird, though I do appreciate the mindset of treating inputs as if they were another streaming channel. There are minimal picture controls, though for such an inexpensive TV that seems fine. Out of the box the picture was quite accurate: I just put the TV in Movie mode and I was good to go. If you have a setup disc like World of Wonder you can fine-tune contrast and brightness, but even those were within a click or two of correct on my sample. I compared the TCL 4-Series against two TVs: the Vizio V555-J and the Samsung QN55Q60A.The Vizio V555 is a direct competitor and roughly 10% more expensive. The Samsung QN55Q60A is its entry-level QLED model, but ""entry-level"" is different for Samsung, and the Q60 is more than twice the price of the S435. My intention was to give buyers an idea what they can get if they spend a bit more. I connected all three via a Monoprice 1x4 distribution amplifier and viewed them side-by-side-by-side. As you'd probably expect, the Vizio and TCL are very close. Both have highly accurate colors and color temperature out of the box. The TCL measures about 10% brighter, but even in side-by-side comparisons you can't really tell that. The Vizio has a slightly higher contrast ratio, but again, that's hard to tell because the difference is so slight. It's a bit of a different story with HDR content. Both the TCL and Vizio have a spot-on color gamut for non-HDR content, but neither makes much of a push beyond that. One of the things you get with the Samsung is a wider selection of colors. So with HDR content it looks far more colorful with deeper, richer tones. None of these TVs have local dimming, so they don't do much in the way of dynamic range for HDR content. Does lack of HDR punch matter when it comes to the TCL? I would say not really for the price, but better HDR performance is definitely one of the things you'll get if you spend more. If you do send the TCL an HDR signal, it does remap it well, so there are no blatant artifacts or serious highlight clipping (white, snow-capped peaks turning out gray, for example). It just doesn't look much better than non-HDR material. Like nearly all LCDs, the TCL doesn't look great if you're not sitting directly in front of it. Even sliding over a few seats on my couch, the black level went up and the color saturation went down. The same was true with the comparison TVs, though, so we'll call that a wash. There are also some uniformity issues, where different parts of the screen have different brightness levels. This is especially noticeable on full-screen white or black images and is exacerbated if you're not directly in line with the TV. The Vizio was about the same, though the Samsung was a little better. The question is, can you get a good 55-inch TV for $400? The answer is yes. But the question: Is the TCL 4-Series the one to offer it? The Vizio V555 is able to be tweaked for a potentially better picture and has a higher-quality remote, but it doesn't have as many streaming options nor is it quite as easy to use. It's hard to beat the Roku interface for simplicity and breadth of content. If someone said to me, ""My parents need a new TV"" or, ""I just want something that looks good and works,"" this TCL is what I'd point them toward. You'll need to spend more to get a better image, of course, but the 4-Series looks better than you'd expect for the price.

17,4,Whathifi,,https://www.whathifi.com/us/advice/should-you-buy-a-tcl-tv,Should you buy a TCL TV if there's a good deal to be had?,"TCL has built a reputation for making affordable TVs loaded with streaming smarts. Indeed, the Chinese brand ranked no.2 in North America in terms of market share in 2020. But should you buy a TCL TV if you spot a good deal? Read on for our take on TCL...TCL TVs are generally pretty cheap compared to those offered by the likes of Samsung, Sony and LG, so it's no wonder people are tempted. And, despite the budget prices, TCL doesn't scrimp on features – the company even offers QLED models with Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos support. But are TCL TVs actually any good? And should you buy one if you spot a good deal? While we haven't had the pleasure of testing every TCL TV on the market, we've run the rule over their spec sheets and picked out some tempting deals for your consideration. If your priority is screen size and pixels-per-pound, TCL TVs are well worth considering – especially if you want a TV with built-in smart apps. TCL now offers both Roku- and Google-powered sets, so you can choose between two of the best smart TV platforms on the market. That's a big tick in the features box, but what about picture quality? We've only tested a fraction of what TCL offers but, from what we've seen, the company has raised its game over the last 12 months. The 55RP620K, for example, received five stars in our review. That said, we'd temper your expectations when it comes to ultimate 4K HDR performance. Those after the true splendour of 4K HDR content might be better served by one of these best TVs from Sony, Samsung, LG or Panasonic. All in all, TCL seems to be a brand that is on up, in the UK, US and beyond. From basic models to giant 8K QLED sets, there are all sorts of models to choose from. Of course, TCL isn't the only cheap TV brand around and with seasonal deals flooding onto the internet, you may wish to check out our pick of the best TV deals around."
18,4,Reviewed,4,https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/content/tcl-4-series-roku-tv-review,"If you’re looking for a great TV and don’t want to spend thousands of dollars, you’re in luck","If you’re looking for a great TV and don’t want to spend thousands of dollars, you’re in luck: There are more viable options these days than ever before. Enter the TCL 4-Series (2021) (available at Amazon for $259.99), a highly affordable but reliably kitted-out 4K Roku TV that, while far from perfect, still punches above its price and delivers a great user experience. Starting at just $349 for the 43-inch model, the 4-Series is as affordable as it is flexible: This series runs the screen size gamut from 43 to 85 inches and even comes in software variants, with Roku (the version we tested), Google, and Android smart platforms available depending upon retailer and region. But no matter which one you buy, you’re getting 4K resolution, HDR compatibility, and solid general picture quality. There are some reasons you might want to spend a bit more. This is an entry-level 4K TV, and despite being HDR compatible, it’s simply not bright or colorful enough for good HDR performance. The basics of its picture are solid, but it’s not equipped to be a great choice for current game consoles, and its backlight isn’t powerful enough for especially bright rooms. But if you just want to soup up movie night with 4K resolution and don’t want to spend a bundle, the 4-Series won’t let you down. TCL has been releasing a version of the 4-Series for the last several years. When we reviewed the 2019 version, we were very impressed with its value and gave it an Editor’s Choice award. The 4-Series TVs are not the cheapest TVs on the block by any means, but they are more affordable than the average 4K/HDR TV from brands like Sony, LG, and Samsung (the 43-inch Samsung AU8000 is $100 more expensive). One reason the 4-Series is so affordable is that it omits a lot of higher-end features like Dolby Vision, eARC, and Variable Refresh Rate. In addition, the 60Hz refresh rate is less capable of rendering smooth motion than the 120Hz displays you'll see in more premium models. Our review model was a 43-inch TCL 4-Series Roku TV purchased from Amazon. In the box, you’re getting the TV and stand components, a Roku TV remote and batteries, a power cable, and a quick-start guide. Before testing, we allow each TV to run for 12-24 hours (depending upon panel type) to ensure factory calibration has settled properly. To test the TCL 43S435, we measured its contrast and color performance using a Calibrite ColorChecker Display device with DisplayCal 3 software, and measured aspects of its HDR performance using the Windows DisplayTest HDR app. For the SDR results below, we measured the 4-Series in its “Movie” picture mode with the backlight set to “Normal,” which TCL recommends for “most viewing environments.” For the HDR results, we measured the 4-Series in the “Normal HDR” picture mode. The 4-Series TVs offer enough connectivity to allow a range of modern and legacy source devices, but like the simple feature set, it's a base package. Because you aren’t getting HDMI 2.1 inputs in any form, this isn’t the best choice for gamers hoping to get the most out of their Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5, though that's no different from rivals in this price range. Assembling the 4-Series is an easy process: Using four screws, you simply screw two V-shaped feet onto the bottom of the panel, and you're ready in minutes. The end result is not the sleekest TV I’ve ever seen, but it doesn’t look bad by any means. The narrow, black bezels around the screen put picture content front and center, and the 43-inch version is light enough to move around by yourself (though I’d get help with larger sizes). Because it uses a Direct LED (full array) backlight, the 4-Series’ profile is not terribly thin, but you can still wall mount it if you want to. Most people will likely place it on a TV stand, though, and I’m happy to report that it’s quite sturdy, wobbling minimally on its feet when jostled. Around back, you’ll find the connectivity options lined up vertically along the right side of a central protrusion (when approaching from the front). The detachable power cable plugs in on the left side. While there's no HDMI 2.1 to support premium gaming features, three HDMI inputs should be plenty for most living rooms. The 4-Series also includes a composite input (handled via splitter cable) for legacy devices, an RF (coaxial) input for antenna/satellite, and the requisite ports for outgoing audio: HDMI ARC and digital optical out. There’s also an ethernet (LAN) input, which might be a necessity when streaming 4K/HDR content depending on your Wi-Fi speeds. As clickers go, you’re getting the standard Roku TV remote (meaning it doesn’t include a headphone jack or voice controls like you’ll get with the Roku Ultra remote). As always, it’s relatively easy to use, with big navigational buttons, dedicated hotkeys for popular apps (Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and Sling), and side-placed volume/mute keys. Ultimately, the only thing I don’t like about the 4-Series’ design is that it’s kind of chunky, and the plastic used for the chassis feels pretty cheap. That’s the trade-off you make in this price range, however. We’ll talk about its prospects for HDR content below, but I’m happy to say (and unsurprised) that the 4-Series is a good choice for general viewing. Having just reviewed the 3-Series, the 4-Series’ crisp 4K resolution especially fetching, and it’s great to get a “modern” resolution in this price range. The first thing I did was watch some 4K footage of animals and parrots on YouTube, and the level of detail was terrific. While brighter than the 3-Series, TCL's 4-Series is not the brightest TV around. But it makes up for its shortcomings there to some degree with surprisingly good black levels for a TV that doesn’t have any local backlight dimming. The 4-Series uses what’s called a Direct LED backlight, meaning there are diodes arrayed evenly behind the screen. To that end, while it won’t blow you away with brightness, its general picture composition is very sound, and capable of good enough black levels for movie night. In that same vein, the 4-Series is not the most colorful TV around: Like most LED/LCD TVs, it can only produce so much color on its own without the addition of enhancements like quantum dots. The TV’s colorimetry—that is to say, how well it expresses individual hues as it moves from darker to brighter shades—is sound, and it is capable of rich, vibrant colors by standard dynamic range expectations. All this to say that the 4-Series checks off all the basic boxes, and does so while supplying you with step-up 4K resolution (compared to TCL’s more affordable TVs). As we’ll discuss more below, however, it really only gets halfway there where HDR is concerned, and has some other little flaws that interested buyers should be aware of. Because the 4-Series comes in multiple flavors of smart software (Roku, Android TV, and Google TV), your experience here may vary from ours. However, we tested a Roku TV version (our preference from amongst those options), and can confirm that it remains a great choice for most users. Unless you’re a Google or Android TV diehard, the simplicity of Roku’s software is sure to appeal to the majority of users. Setup requires connecting the 4-Series to your Roku account (or creating one new) and choosing which streaming apps you’d like to install. From there, it’s almost as simple and pointing and clicking. Within minutes of watching the TV’s short video tutorial guiding me through the software, I was watching 4K/HDR footage on YouTube. And outside of the need to sign in to your accounts, jumping into a show on Netflix or Disney+ is just as simple. One small thing I found a bit irksome is that one of the “channels” (Roku’s term for apps) was nonfunctioning: something called Screen Dreams Fireplace, which I had installed on a Roku TV years ago, migrated over but simply wasn’t supported anymore. It made me wonder how carefully the folks at Roku were tending to the thousands of channels still available in the Roku Store. The other small nitpick I have is how the TV hides its more advanced picture adjustment options in the Roku mobile app, which isn’t new, but may be more relevant on a 4K/HDR TV like this one than something more basic. You’ll need to download the app to access somewhat vital processes like changing the picture mode or adjusting contrast/brightness tolerances, something that tends to come up when calibrating for HDR gaming. It’s a minor extra step, but it doesn’t sell the 4-Series to power users very well. For all tasks more casual, however, you really can’t go wrong with a Roku TV like the 4-Series. Between the streaming staples (Netflix, Prime Video, Apple TV+, etc.) and Roku’s own stable of free-to-watch content, you may never need to plug in a set-top box or streaming device. HDR is a complicated topic, but the most important thing to understand is that HDR content is created to look best on TVs that are very bright and colorful—two things the 4-Series is decidedly not. On the other hand, HDR compatibility is never a bad thing, and I enjoyed watching HDR10 movies on the 4-Series. The chase through the sandstorm scene in Mad Max: Fury Road still boasts intense colors and surprisingly bright flashes of light, but only relative to the 4-Series’ relatively dim general brightness and the muted, sandy coloration of the background. However, Reviewed is of the opinion that a legitimate HDR TV will need to boast at least 400 nits of peak brightness, and the 4-Series tops out at just 270 nits. And as previously stated, without quantum dots the 4-Series simply can’t produce the highly saturated colors called for by HDR color spaces. You can certainly still enjoy HDR content and HDR gaming on this TV, just don’t expect it to look and feel like the next-gen feature it’s touted as. Another knock against the 4-Series is its limited horizontal viewing angle. While viewing the 43-inch 4-Series, its brightness and color fidelity dropped off fairly sharply as I moved from head-on viewing out to the left or right of the screen. This isn’t a huge problem in a smaller 43-inch size, especially depending upon viewing distance, but it’s very worth keeping in mind if you’re shopping for one of the really big sizes. Sitting closer to the screen when you watch is one of the advantages of 4K resolution, but if you sit too close to the 75- or 85-inch 4-Series, you might see viewing angle discrepancies even during head-on viewing. Not great, Bob. Then again, this is a problem with a lot of LED panels, including higher-priced options in TCL's line and plenty of competitors, too. By way of its spec sheet, the 4-Series’ 4K resolution and HDR compatibility might make it seem like an awesome choice for the newest gaming consoles. I’m here to tell you, it’s only just okay. The biggest discrepancy is that you’re only getting a 60Hz refresh rate, which means no gaming in 4K at 120fps, one of the biggest draws of a new console like the Xbox Series X. However, you’re also not getting newer features like Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) or Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). And as discussed above, the HDR performance is just so-so. That said, if you’re still playing on a PS4 or Xbox One/S/X, the 4-Series can deliver you to the mecca of 4K/60fps gaming, and it’ll look great in a room with average or dim lighting. Within those specifications, you can expect relatively low input lag too, meaning games will be snappy and enjoyable to play. It wasn’t so long ago that buying a 4K TV was an utterly expensive endeavor, but with the 4-Series, that technology has become decidedly mainstream. You can find the 43-inch 4-Series for as low as $299 online at time of writing, which is certainly an attractive price for a modern TV. The main thing to understand before purchase is that the 4-Series falls short of the pricier competition in a few key areas. Like a lot of budget sets, it's got a poor viewing angle that may be especially impactful if you were aiming for one of the really big sizes. It’s also fairly dim and not equipped for highly saturated colors, meaning it isn’t the best choice if you’re after stunning HDR performance or want to watch in a bright room. If your room is brighter or you want more impactful HDR, you’re going to have to spend a little more: the Samsung AU8000 isn’t much pricier and will net you more brightness and HDR color saturation (though we prefer the Roku platform of the 4-Series for its simplicity). You could also jump to TCL’s 5-Series, which offers a lot more brightness and even quantum dot color for a manageable step-up price. That said, if you just need a solid 4K TV that's easy to use, looks good in most conditions, and won't cost a mint, the TCL 4-Series is a great option."
19,4,Techradar,4,https://www.techradar.com/news/should-i-buy-a-tcl-4-series-tv,"If you're in the market for a cheap LCD TV and want to know you're getting a modicum of quality, you may well have your eye on this budget set from the Chinese electronics maker.","Should you buy the TCL 4-Series? If you're in the market for a cheap LCD TV and want to know you're getting a modicum of quality,  you may well have your eye on this budget set from the Chinese electronics maker. While you'll want to opt for the 5-Series QLED or 6-Series QLED for a step up in picture quality – with their quantum dot upgrades improving color and contrast – the 4-Series undercuts both on price and may just be the entry-level screen that you're after. (On the other hand, the even cheaper TCL 3-Series might be a good choice for those after one of the best small TVs.) TCL has good form for aggressive pricing that often brings mid-range or even premium features within reach of smaller budgets – and the inclusion of the Roku platform is very notable on such a value TV. But what sacrifices will you have to make at this price, and is the overall package worth it? Here's everything you need to know about the TCL 4-Series TV. The TCL 4-Series is a budget set, starting at just $289 for a 43-inch size (43S435), and $349 for a 50-inch size (50S435) – going up to $399 for a 55-inch model (55S435) and $799 for a 75-inch option (75S435). You'll notice that's quite a big uptick for its largest size – almost twice the price – and in general we advise against getting truly budget screens at such massive sizes, as it's a lot harder to make a 75-inch 4K TV look good with a cheap processor than it is a 32-inch screen. By comparison, the TCL 5-Series QLED starts at $499 for a 50-inch size, showing a significant uptick in price. It may be worth looking out for the older TCL 5-Series (2018), though, where you can still find it. It ships without QLED panel tech but is on a par with the 4-Series pricing, starting at $299 for a 43-inch model, and featuring an interim 65-inch size for $569. Rtings reports that the 2019 4-Series model has ""somewhat low input lag, which is great for video games, and delivers a little crisper motion thanks to the faster response time,"" but that the 2018 5-Series ""can get brighter"" and displays ""a wider color gamut, which helps HDR performance."" Before you buy, though, it'd be good to know what you're getting for the money! The TCL 4-Series does pack in 4K resolution across all sizing options, as well as basic HDR support (meaning the HDR10 standard) and the HLG SDR/HDR broadcast standard. The main draw is the Roku TV platform, which offers expansive app support with the likes of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Spotify, YouTube, Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, and more – as well as the Roku Channel with thousands of hours of free television content. The Roku OS is a real joy compared to many basic, proprietary platforms often found on cheap sets, and there's a reason you'll find it on TCL TVs, Hisense TVs, and Roku streaming sticks alike. The TCL 4-Series also comes with Apple AirPlay support for casting from Apple devices, and compatibility with the Siri, Alexa and Google voice assistants when connected to other smart devices. You're getting three HDMI ports, with one that support ARC (audio return channel), which means it can passthrough audio from the TV to a soundbar and be controlled by the TV's remote. Wi-Fi is supported too. The 4-Series packs in a total 16W audio output (x2 8W speakers), which is decent for a television of this price (cheap TVs often cap out at 10W). The TCL 4-Series is a cheap TV that ticks the main boxes for a television of 40 inches and above: 4K resolution, basic HDR support, and some voice assistant smarts. The Roku TV platform is one big advantage for this set, though it's worth noting that a Roku Express streaming stick will only set you back around $30 – meaning it may be cheaper to get a plug-in dongle rather than purchase a whole new television if you only want a better platform. You don't have to pay too much more to get a decent uptick in picture quality either, with the 5-Series QLED still offering relatively good value. If you're sticking to a 43-inch size, though, or don't have the cash for a QLED model, then the 4-Series should meet your needs a cheap, small TV with the basic specifications expected of a 4K TV today. Just don't expect anything too impressive from the picture."
20,4,PCMag,3,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/tcl-43s435,The TCL 4-Series line of TVs offers modest picture quality and Roku functionality at a rock-bottom price.,"TCL is no stranger to budget-friendly TVs, and it has consistently impressed us with its 6-Series, which offers excellent performance for a reasonable price. It’s one of the company’s more expensive lines, though, so it's probably not the one to consider if you're shopping on a tight budget. The TCL 4-Series can be had for about half that amount (starting as low as $259.99 for the 43-inch 43S435 we tested), which is about as low as you'll pay for a brand-new TV. It makes many compromises in performance to reach that price, though. The S435 looks very plain, which is unsurprising for a budget TV. Its screen is surrounded on the top and sides by narrow, glossy black plastic bezels. The bottom bezel thickens into a wider, brushed-texture area that holds a silver TCL logo in the middle. A combination power and input button can be found on the bottom edge of the TV, just behind the logo. The screen sits on two V-shaped glossy black plastic feet that match the bezels and sides. A power connector can be found on the left side of the back of the TV, facing left. All other connections are on the right side of the back panel, facing right. They include three HDMI ports (as opposed to the more common four), a USB port, an Ethernet port, a 3.5mm composite video port (an adapter is not included), a 3.5mm headphone jack, an optical audio output, and an antenna/cable connector. The included remote is a standard Roku TV remote. It’s a short, thin black plastic wand with a prominent purple plus-shaped navigation pad near the top. Home, Back, and Power buttons sit above the pad, while playback controls and dedicated service buttons for Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and Sling TV sit below it. The right edge of the remote holds a volume rocker and a mute button. Because this is a non-enhanced Roku remote, it communicates with the TV entirely through infrared, and requires direct line of sight with the screen. It lacks a pinhole microphone, so you can’t use Roku voice search with it. For wireless control that supports voice search and doesn’t need line of sight, you’ll need to look at a higher-end TV, like TCL's 6-Series. For smart features, the 4-Series uses Roku TV, which provides the same apps and services as a Roku media streamer. Most big names are available, including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube (though Twitch remains absent from Roku’s library). The TV is also Apple AirPlay compatible, letting you stream content from your Mac or iOS device. WiDi/Miracast enables wireless screen mirroring from Windows PCs and some Android devices, but Google Cast isn't available for streamlined Android streaming. The TCL 43S435 is a 4K high dynamic range (HDR) TV with a 60Hz refresh rate. It's compatible with HDR10 and HLG, but not Dolby Vision. We test TVs with a Klein K-80 colorimeter, a Murideo SIX-G signal generator, and Portrait Displays’ Calman software using methodology based on Imaging Science Foundation’s calibration techniques. Out of the box, in Movie mode (the most color-accurate mode on the TV) with an SDR signal, the 43S435 shows a peak brightness of 208.381cd/m^2 and a black level of 0.07cd/m^2, for an effective contrast ratio of 3,155:1. This isn’t particularly bright, but that’s not unexpected for such an inexpensive TV. Brightness can be pushed to 273.228cd/m^2 in Normal mode for a 4,027:1 contrast ratio, but this mode makes for significantly cooler colors. An HDR signal won’t change the 43S435’s contrast performance like it will on some higher-end TVs. The numbers we measured with an HDR10 signal were very similar to SDR, whether we used Dark (HDR) or Bright (HDR) picture modes. While HDR won’t make the picture any brighter, it can drastically broaden the 43S435’s color range. The above chart shows color performance with an SDR signal compared against Rec.709 broadcast standards and performance with an HDR signal compared against DCI-P3 digital cinema standards. SDR colors are generally very accurate, though reds are a bit oversaturated. With an HDR picture, the TV makes an admirable attempt to cover the color space, hitting blues and reds almost spot-on and reaching fairly deep into green. Magentas lean slightly blue and yellows slightly red, but otherwise it’s surprisingly strong color performance for such a low-price panel. When playing BBC’s Planet Earth II, colors look generally balanced on the 43S435, though greens appear a bit undersaturated and aren’t nearly as vivid as they could be. Fine details like fur are crisp and sharp when lit well, but they tend to fade and disappear in darker, heavily shadowed parts of the frame. While the 43S435’s greens aren’t very impressive, reds are nice and deep, as seen when watching Deadpool on the TV. Deadpool’s costume looks properly vibrant in the opening scene, even under the overcast lighting, and skin tones appear natural. The flames in the burning lab fight look bright and vivid, but again the TV’s modest contrast comes through with faded shadow details against the fire. The high-contrast party scenes in The Great Gatsby don’t look terrible on the 43S435, but dark details like the cuts and textures of black suits can appear washed out or muddy depending on the overall brightness of the frame. Skin tones again look natural and balanced against the dark blacks and whites. We test TV input lag using an HDFury Diva HDMI matrix, determining how long it takes between when a TV receives a signal and the screen updates. The 43S435 showed a mediocre 45.2-millisecond input lag with Game Mode disabled. Turning Game Mode on cuts that input lag to 23.3ms, which is a significant improvement, but still above the 20ms threshold we use to consider a TV among the best for gaming. TCL’s 4-Series isn’t particularly impressive in any way, but it’s a reasonable performer for the price. At $260 for 43 inches and just $500 for a 65-inch model, it should appeal to anyone looking to get a decent TV while spending as little as possible. The Insignia DF710NA21 line is also less expensive than higher-end TCL and Hisense models; it ekes out slightly better contrast and color performance than the 4-Series, and its Amazon Fire TV platform has handy features like a voice assistant. That said, while they cost a fair amount more, the TCL 6-Series and the Hisense H8G line offer far brighter, higher-contrast pictures with superior color, making them worth the relative premium if you can afford it.

As expected, it's an amazing TV, but aside from a few minor tweaks and upgrades—like the new 'Game Optimizer' settings, a redesigned Magic Remote, and a new version of webOS—it performs about the same as its predecessor. Like all OLED TVs, it has self-lit pixels that can be turned off individually to produce an almost infinite contrast ratio, with dark inky blacks and no distracting blooming around bright objects. Unfortunately, the unit we tested has exceptionally poor out-of-the-box color accuracy, but that can vary between units, so we may have just gotten one with a bad panel. Our testing also confirmed that, unlike the higher-end LG G1 OLED, it doesn't have LG's new evo panel. Despite these quibbles, the C1 still has a lot to offer, including a new setting for lower input lag, as well as a near-instantaneous response time and variable refresh rate (VRR) support. The LG C1 OLED is an amazing all-around TV. It has stunning picture quality thanks to its near-infinite contrast ratio, which is great for watching movies or gaming in the dark. The near-instantaneous response time makes motion look exceptionally clear in fast-moving games and sports, and its low input lag is great for gaming or use as a PC monitor. While it doesn't get very bright for HDR, its high contrast helps it deliver an impressive HDR experience. The LG C1 is fantastic for watching movies. Its near-infinite contrast ratio produces deep inky blacks that look amazing in a dark room, with no distracting blooming around bright objects. It does a great job upscaling lower-resolution movies, great if you have a collection of Blu-rays or DVDs, and it can remove judder from all sources. Unfortunately, the TV's near-instantaneous response time causes stutter that may bother some people. The LG C1 OLED is great for watching TV shows in a bright room. It has incredibly wide viewing angles, so the image is accurate, even if you have a wide seating arrangement or if you like to move around while watching TV. Unfortunately, it's not bright enough to overcome direct sunlight, but most people won't have any issues with it. On the upside, it has incredible reflection handling and upscales low-resolution content without issue. The LG C1 is an excellent TV for watching sports. Thanks to its near-instantaneous response time, motion looks exceptionally clear. It upscales cable channels well, with no noticeable issues. If you like to watch games with friends, its wide viewing angles provide an accurate image even from the side. That said, its brightness is limited, so it's not great if you have a room with lots of direct sunlight. The LG C1 OLED is incredible for playing video games. It has very little input lag and a near-instantaneous response time for smooth motion. It supports FreeSync, G-SYNC, and HDMI Forum VRR, and its near-infinite contrast makes games look stunning when playing in a dark room. Unfortunately, the risk for burn-in goes up with extended exposure to static elements like a game HUD, but we don't expect it to be an issue if you watch and play varied content. The LG C1 is amazing for watching movies in HDR. It supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision but not HDR10+. It's unfortunately not very bright, so it may not bring out the brightest highlights, but its near-infinite contrast ratio still allows it to deliver an impressive HDR experience. It also has a wide color gamut but doesn't map every color well, which most people won't notice, but some colors may appear inaccurate. The LG C1 OLED is a superb TV for HDR gaming. Motion looks exceptionally clear thanks to the near-instantaneous response time, and input lag is very low. Unfortunately, its HDR brightness is just okay, so the brightest highlights don't stand out as well as they should, but the near-infinite contrast ratio still helps deliver an impressive HDR experience. There's a risk of permanent burn-in, but we don't expect this to be an issue if you watch and play varied content. The LG C1 TV is excellent for use as a PC monitor. It has wide viewing angles, so the image doesn't look washed out at the edges when sitting up close. It also has a very low input lag and exceptionally fast response time. Finally, it can display proper chroma 4:4:4, which is important for clear text, and it supports FreeSync and G-SYNC VRR. Unfortunately, static elements like a desktop interface increase the risk of permanent burn-in, but there are options to reduce the likelihood of this issue."
22,5,Techradar,5,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-c1-oled-tv-oled65c1,"Although there's a newer model available, the LG C1 OLED remains one of the best TVs at any price","Although there's a newer model available, the LG C1 OLED remains one of the best TVs at any price. It’s missing the new OLED evo panels going into the G1 OLED, but even in their absence the C1 produces colorful, bright and rich pictures with support for most types of HDR. There might be one or two areas for improvement, but otherwise the LG C1 OLED remains a great option. Although it's since been eclipsed by a newer model, the LG C1 OLED was the follow up to TechRadar’s best TV of 2020, the LG CX OLED, and won the first-place spot on our list of the best TVs of 2021. Now, of course, there's a new LG C2 OLED out there that's sweeping awards - but that doesn't mean the C1 OLED is destined for the dump. That’s because, as it stands, the LG C1 OLED is still a perfectly viable option for a new OLED TV. It uses LG’s Alpha a9 Gen. 4 processor for great upscaling and virtual surround sound audio, and with four separate HDMI 2.1 ports, it’s ready for the PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and whatever next-gen consoles can throw at it. Gamers will also appreciate the new Game Optimiser menu that gives you the option to quickly adjust brightness, contrast and VRR on the fly. As with this year's model, you’ll find support for both Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, who can be summoned using buttons on your remote, and a near-complete repository of streaming services that includes Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and many more. The LG C1 isn’t flawless, as we did encounter issues around how the new Alpha a9 Gen. 4 upscales faces, and how reflective the all-glass screen is in the daylight, but the issues are few and far between. There are, of course, higher resolution TVs out there right now like the LG Z1 OLED, which offers 8K resolution, and the previously mentioned LG C2 OLED and LG G1 Gallery Series that uses the coveted OLED evo panels that offer better brightness. However, if you can find one at the right price, the LG C1 OLED is still an incredible purchase, and one that comes highly recommended by our staff. The LG C1 OLED is part of the LG 2021 TV lineup that includes the new LG A1 OLED, LG G1 OLED and LG Z1 OLED, as well as the new QNED TVs like the QNED99, QNED95, QNED90 and QNED85. The LG C1 is the cheapest OLED in the lineup that uses the new Alpha a9 Gen. 4 processor (the A1 OLED will be cheaper but uses the a7 processor), however it’s still not exactly what we’d consider cheap: If you compare those prices to last year, the LG C1 OLED costs the exact same as the LG CX OLED cost when it first came out last year, though you can now find the latter at a discount now that the LG C1 is readily available. Because there’s not a significant difference between the two other than the processor, it’s probably worth picking up last year’s model at a steep discount if you can find one. It makes sense that last year’s TV is now cheaper, but how does the C1 OLED’s price compare to other OLED TVs? Compared to the new Sony A80J OLED that costs $2,799 for the 65-inch version, the C1 OLED is a bit cheaper for US buyers, but UK buyers will be paying £4,199 for the 65-inch Sony A80J so the £2,499 C1 OLED is a steal in comparison. There are cheaper alternatives, however, like the Vizio OLED TV that starts at just $1,199 for a 55-inch model or the Panasonic HZ980 that costs just £1,098 from Currys. There are some drawbacks to both those TVs (starting with the lack of HDMI 2.1 ports) but they are cheaper and provide similarly deep black levels. It can feel silly to talk about how a TV looks on the outside – it’s the picture that matters most, after all –  but you can’t ignore how nice the LG C1 OLED is design-wise. The front of the TV is pure minimalism – there’s a long silver stand that holds the TV upright and only  a millimeter or two between the picture and the edge of the display. If you were to mount it, pretty much all you’d see is the screen, but putting it on its (quite hefty) stand still looks great. That extra heft prevents the TV from wobbling and gives the C1 a low center of gravity. Spin the TV around to the side and you’ll see the razor-thin OLED screen; it’s thinner than your smartphone and it looks a lot nicer, too. Toward the bottom of the TV, near where the stand screws in, the TV’s a bit thicker to house the components and the speakers, but even that section isn’t larger than most full array LED-LCD TVs In fact, the only real problem with the C1’s design is that the front all-glass screen is fairly reflective. Put it in a moderately lit room with streams of light coming in and it’s easy to catch a glare. Sure, that glare subsides some when you’ve got bright and colorful content playing on the screen, but any night or space scene will have a glare if you can’t close the blinds. Outside of that one sore spot, however, the rest of the design gets full marks. In terms of ports, the C1 has four full-spec HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 144Hz, plus you’ve got three USBs, RF tuner, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and optical digital audio output. Last but not least, one of the HDMI ports supports eARC/ARC, which is great for folks with an AVR or soundbar who don’t like to have more than one remote in use. Speaking of remotes, the LG C1 OLED comes with the wonderful LG Magic Remote that’s Bluetooth-enabled and has a built-in microphone for voice searches. The remote feels great in the hand and runs off two AA batteries. What we love most is that the UI can either be controlled using Wii-style motion controls or the directional pad, or you can use the four quick launch buttons down at the bottom to the most popular apps. If you’ve used an LG TV in pretty much the past decade, you’ll know what to expect with the C1 OLED – yep, it’s WebOS. What makes WebOS an old staple of LG TVs is its flexibility to add new channels as soon as they arise, and support of multiple partners. Put simply, because it doesn’t have any allegiances to Google, Amazon or Apple, WebOS supports all of the above simultaneously with a zippy UI and robust customization system. The only major change this year is that there’s more of a focus on the actual ThinQ AI home screen that you’ll see every time you press the home button. Here, you’ll find your most frequently used apps as well as any devices you’ve connected to ThinQ AI. Speaking of apps, nearly every major app is presented and accounted for, including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Vudu, Sling TV, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus and Apple TV. For music streaming your options are slightly more limited, but you can still pick from Spotify, Plex, Pandora, Amazon Music and more. Apple Music is now available through the TV too. While WebOS hasn’t added many new features this year outside of the new homescreen with more rows, there are still some nice additions from last year worth calling attention to. Chief among them is Sports integration where, if you tell the C1 what your favorite sports teams are, WebOS will give you score updates and remind you when your teams are playing. More useful, however, is the support for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant built right into the TV that can be accessed by pressing the corresponding buttons on the remote, as well as support for AirPlay and Casting from your phone or tablet. We had a bit of problems getting AirPlay to work properly during our testing – but Casting worked perfectly. LG’s 2021 OLED TV lineup is divided into two categories this year: OLED TVs with LG’s new OLED evo panels and those without it. For those wondering, the LG C1 doesn’t have it – and yet, even without the new panel it’s still one of the best OLED TVs we’ve seen. What the OLED evo panel adds is additional brightness through a new lighting element in the self-emissive pixels. That’s absent from the LG C1 OLED, but we found that it isn’t really lacking in brightness. In our moderately bright (i.e. some ambient light) living room, the picture looked gorgeous. Sure, the reflective glare ate into the inky black levels, but we found the brightness of the screen to compensate nicely for the ambient light. The reason the C1 is able to do that is because the light sensor built into the TV measures levels of ambient light and calibrates the picture accordingly. If the TV sees that there’s more light in the room, it adds extra brightness to the screen. That peak brightness still isn’t as high as, say, the peak luminance on the new Samsung QN900A QLED, but it’s getting closer to the 1,000-nit mark that rival LED-LCD TVs shoot for. Speaking of brightness and contrast, the C1 OLED supports most major flavors of HDR – including HDR10, Dolby Vision and HLG – with the minor exception being HDR10+. That last bit means you won’t see shows from Amazon Prime live up to their full potential, but services like Netflix, Vudu and Disney will all have Dolby Vision content enabled. Watching the opening of Falcon and The Winter Soldier, the crimson reds of Captain America’s shield and the deep blues of the sky looked outstanding. And while no part of the show blinded us with bright HDR highlights – again the LG C1 OLED doesn’t use the new OLED evo panels like the LG G1 OLED – any dark scene looked significantly richer on the C1 OLED than on any LED-LCD we tried in the last 12 months. Because the pixels themselves are self-emissive, there’s little to no light bleed and objects moving across the screen look cleaner than on LED-LCD TVs. There’s still a bit of motion blur, but LG’s motion processing has seen a real improvement in the last few years. In fact, the only area that could stand to be improved in terms of picture quality is the way the Alpha a9 Gen 4 processor handles faces – leaving a bit of a reddish hue and graininess. Watching shows like The Grand Tour on Amazon Prime, you’ll see a dash of redness in the hosts’ faces while faces on characters in HD content upscaled to 4K can have some noticeable grain. LG is aware of that fact, clearly, as that’s a major focus for the Alpha a9 Gen 4 processor, but there’s still a little more work to be done in that area. Thankfully, the processor does an excellent job at upscaling. Films from the mid-2000s look like they were shot and distributed in 4K despite being streamed in HD, as does content from an HD OTA antenna – which is a real feat of engineering. Speaking of engineering, it’s definitely worth talking about the new gaming features on this year’s C-Series OLED as that’s where the majority of the innovation is this year. For starters, there’s that new Game Optimiser setting that allows you to quickly adjust the White Stabilizer, Black Stabilizer and VRR. You’ve also got support for ALLM when the OLED detects an incoming game signal through any one of the four HDMI 2.1 ports and a Prevent Input Delay feature that drops input latency to sub-10ms. Of course, not every game is going to play at 4K/120Hz right now – few even play at 1440p/120Hz or 1080p/120Hz – but you’ll appreciate those that do. Forza Horizon 4 is among the chosen few, though, and it looks incredible on the C1 OLED. Taking cars out on the backcountry roads feels slick and responsive without compromising on visual fidelity. Long story short, if you’re a gamer-turned-cinephile or vice versa, the LG C1 OLED is competent enough to please both camps in the visual department and is well worth the upgrade from an LED-LCD TV. Last but not least, it’s worth noting that the LG C1 is totally customizable and great for calibration. If you’re someone who loves tweaking picture settings, the C1 has deep customization options for white point balancing and individual color calibration. If that sounds too challenging, however, we found the default Calibrated settings with a neutral color tone instead of warm really makes the TV look great. Picture enhancements aren’t the only tricks up the LG C1 OLED’s sleeve this year – it’s also got a pretty neat AI Sound upscaling feature that transforms basic stereo audio tracks into virtual 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos sound with a fair amount of verticality and that makes the LG C1 OLED sounds a heck of a lot better than your standard TV speakers. Admittedly, it’s not quite better than a standalone soundbar – especially if you pit it against one of the best soundbars like the Sonos Arc – but out-of-the-box sound should be more than adequate for most people. The only real issue we noticed is that, if you don’t have sound leveling turned on, audio can be a bit all over the place – meaning you’ll hear booming bass and nearly sibilant highs with weaker dialogue when watching that big new Hollywood blockbuster. For us, it happened during Falcon and The Winter Soldier where the sound effects were fantastic but the actual actors’ voices were getting lost in the mix. Thankfully, if you notice the same issue, you can tweak that by either setting the default sound profile to Enhanced Dialogue or turn on volume leveling. Both might mean forgoing some of the booming bass, but the result is a more balanced sound that’s easier to listen to for extended periods of time. However, if you are a soundbar owner or will become one in the near future, the LG C1 supports ARC and eARC through one of the four HDMI ports. That will allow you to pass Dolby Atmos sound from the TV to the soundbar and use a single remote to control the volume. It’s extremely convenient, and worth taking advantage of if you don’t already. You want one of the best TVs this year While there are more expensive options out there with a higher peak brightness, the LG C1 is that perfect balance between price and performance. You’re getting 99% of the performance of the top-tier TVs without cleaning out your bank account. It’s more expensive than some budget models, true, but its moderately expensive price tag is well worth it. You want an easy, simple-to-use smart platform Having tried every major smart TV platform out there, we can genuinely say that WebOS is one of the best out there. It’s fast and robust with nearly every major service present and accounted for, plus it’s deeply customizable and works with both major smart assistants. You’re a gamer with next-gen consoles With four HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz, this is the TV next-gen gamers have been waiting for. Tack on Game Optimiser that gives gamers a quick and easy way to turn on VRR and Nvidia G-Sync, and you’ve got a very compelling monitor alternative. You can find a great deal on the LG CX OLED The addition of the new Alpha a9 Gen 4 processor makes the LG C1 a better TV than the LG CX OLED, but not by much. That said, if you can find a great deal on last year’s flagship OLED, we still highly recommend it. Glare can be an issue for you While the all-glass front screen is gorgeous, it’s also highly reflective. If you’ve had problems with glare in the past – or know that the TV will be facing a light source head-on – you might want to consider a QLED TV instead. You want something even brighter The LG C1 OLED looks brighter than previous years, but it doesn’t use LG’s new OLED evo panels that are engineered from the ground-up for higher peak brightness. If you’ve seen OLEDs in the past and weren’t impressed by their brightness, you might be a good candidate for the LG G1 OLED with the new OLED evo panel instead."
23,5,Tom's guide,4.5,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/lg-c1-oled-tv,"A gorgeous OLED, a great 4K smart TV, and the best gaming TV we've ever seen","The LG C1 OLED is one of the best TVs you can buy, and definitely the best choice for gamers. In almost every respect, it delivers exactly what you expect from a premium OLED TV. The LG C1 OLED continues LG's track record of making some of the best TVs you can buy. The foundation of that dominance is OLED technology – the best TV display technology on the market for the last several years. But our LG C1 OLED review shows how LG has built on top of that foundation, delivering a great 4K smart TV, with advanced features, a smart platform that supports many popular apps and unique capabilities, and a robust (and growing) collection of gaming features. The LG C1 OLED is more affordable than the premium LG G1 OLED and more capable than the budget-friendly LG A1 OLED that grabbed so much attention over Black Friday. The result is one of the best OLED TVs we've seen all year, and easily the best gaming TV you can buy today. With great performance, a number of welcome improvements to the feature set and interface, and some of the best future-proofing of any 4K smart TV, the LG C1 OLED is one of the top TVs on the market. That said, the LG C1 is being replaced by the LG C2 OLED TV with OLED evo. Though we haven't tested it yet, we created a guide to the LG C2 vs. LG C1 OLED TV to help you decide whether you should get the C1 on sale or splurge for the newer model. LG's OLED TVs are available in a larger range of sizes than ever before, and the C1 OLED boasts the full range of options for a 4K OLED, starting with a compact 48-inch model all the way up to a giant 83-inch set that will be far too large for most homes, but is perfect for a big home theater. If you need help figuring out which version is right for you, be sure to see our guide What size TV should you buy? We've listed the current regular retail prices below, but sales prices are making these TVs more affordable than ever – that's why we bought it ourselves. This end of the year period is also the best time to be shopping for these sets, because the prices are at their lowest point all year, but they fluctuate quite a bit as major sales events like Black Friday start and finish, and prices drop in anticipation of new models being announced in January. (Speaking of the new models, we've got an LG C2 vs LG C1 OLED TV comparison to help you decide which model to buy.) For this review, we tested the 55-inch model. Because these sets vary in size, but are otherwise identical in terms of software, ports and features, we have no doubt that our recommendations will apply to all sizes, with no significant differences between them. You'll get the same great performance and features on models large and small. The LG C1 uses a design that should be familiar, since the C series look is pretty much unchanged over the last several years. It's the same design we saw in our LG CX OLED review in 2020, and the LG C9 OLED before that. But that's not a bad thing at all — the look is still stunning, thanks to the unbelievably thin dimensions of OLED displays and LG's display-on-glass design. It's dramatically thinner than any other premium TV, like the Samsung QN90A Neo QLED TV, which measures a respectable 1-inch thick. Through the entire top half of the TV, the LG C1 measures 0.1-inch thick. There's just no competing with that in terms of a polished, nearly futuristic look. With a thicker component housing on the bottom half of the TV, the TV's overall dimensions are 48.3 x 27.8 x 1.8 inches, and the chunk base of the stand has a footprint that's 9.9 inches deep. It's not super heavy at 41.7 pounds, but you definitely want two people to help set this up, even at the smaller 55-inch size. The thin and slightly flexible panel of the all-glass display is hard to maneuver solo. The pedestal stand that comes with the LG C1 is great, but if you want to wall mount the set, it will work with any 300 x 200 millimeter VESA mount, including several models on our list of the best TV mounts. On the back of the TV there are two panels of ports and connections, one rear-facing and one left facing. The rear-facing panel includes one HDMI input and two USB connections along with coax, ethernet, a headphone jack for audio, a headphone style service port, and a digital optical audio output. On the left-facing panel there are three HDMI 2.1 ports ( one with eARC), and a single USB input. For wireless connectivity, the TV also has built-in 802.11ac and Bluetooth 5.0. The fact that the C1 boasts HDMI 2.1 connectivity on all four of its HDMI ports puts it head and shoulders above the competition, offering advanced capabilities like high frame rate gaming and 4K content at 120Hz. If you have one of the latest game consoles, that's a huge selling point. We expected great picture quality from the C1 by virtue of its OLED display panel. OLED technology offers self-illuminated pixels, with the ability to brighten or darken individual pixels, which translates into exceptional contrast, perfect inky black levels and superior HDR capability. But LG goes a step further, pairing this display with the Alpha 9 Gen 4 AI 4K processor, the latest version of LG's advanced video processing hardware. Basic performance tests showed us what we already expected with the OLED display. Veiwing angles are excellent, with no color shifting even at extreme viewing angles, and perfectly consistent backlight. Unlike even the best LCD TVs, that meant the C1 produced perfectly consistent brightness from corner to corner and edge to edge, which is in keeping with the per-pixel lighting that OLED offers. Watching select 4K samples really drove home the quality of the UHD display. An aerial tour of the coast of Italy showed craggy cliffs and tiny windowed buildings – all small enough to look like miniatures, but with itsy-bitsy cars on the roads and boats floating in the ocean. The blue waters of the ocean were vibrant, the green vegetation was lush, and the cliffside buildings all looked beautiful. Another 4K video of drone footage of Manhattan gave us sharp, detailed views of the Statue of Liberty, as well as various landmarks in and around Manhattan. Blue skies look blue, brightly buildings glowed realistically at night, and shots of the Brooklyn Bridge had realistically detailed brick and high tension wires. It all looked really good. Watching the 4K trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, the vibrant colors all came through bright and life-like, if not a little over-amped and saturated to provide an intentional, unrealistic visual effect. The nearly hallucinogenic imagery looked great on the OLED display, from bright blue pills in the sink to brightly colored clothing and the familiar green matrix code. Once we got the C1 under the scope, the test results spoke to the excellent performance the OLED TV offers. Using an X-Rite i1 Pro spectrophotometer, an AccuPel DVG-5000 video test pattern generator and SpectraCal CalMAN Ultimate calibration software, we test every TV for the most basic elements of picture quality: Color gamut reproduction, color accuracy, and maximum brightness. As expected for an OLED TV, the C1 has fantastic color, and reproduced 131.59% of the Rec 709 color gamut, exceeding the basic standard, much as we've seen in the Sony Bravia XR A80J OLED (128.05%) and the LG G1 OLED TV (133.28%). That's common in OLED displays, which routinely beat out even the best LCD TVs, like the Samsung QN90A Neo QLED, which is one of the best we've tested at 99.78%. Color accuracy was also top-notch, with an average Delta-E rating of 1.25, where lower scores are better — 0 is a perfect score, but anything under 2.0 is considered very good for out of the box accuracy. That makes it one of the most accurate TVs we've ever seen, ahead of last year's LG CX OLED (1.95), or this year's LG G1 OLED (1.63) and Sony A80J (2.88), despite these TVs being some of the best we've seen. Even the best non-OLED TVs, like the Samsung QN90A (2.57) struggle to match this level of accuracy. The TV also offers great brightness, which is one area where OLED displays have traditionally struggled. The LG C1 produced 409 nits of brightness, which is a slightly higher result than the 2020 LG CX OLED (396 nits) or the Vizio OLED TV (373 nits), and only slightly behind the LG G1 OLED (412 nits), which is one of the best results of any OLED TV and features LG's bolder and brighter OLED evo technology. Gamers will also love the short 12.6 milliseconds of lag time that we measured in testing. That matches the impressive Samsung QN90A Neo QLED (12.6ms), and is one of the shortest lag times we've ever measured. But that's only one of the many factors that makes the C1 OLED a fantastic gaming TV. LG has built up the gaming capabilities of the C1 significantly, from raw capability — short lag times, excellent color and contrast — to advanced features, like HDMI 2.1, which offers high-frame rate support and auto low-latency mode (ALLM), which seamlessly switches to gaming mode as soon as you fire up a game on your console. Another key feature of HDMI 2.1 is variable refresh rate (VRR), but LG takes it a step beyond with a combination of exclusive features. The LG C1 OLED boasts Nvidia G-Sync, making it ideal for PC gaming, and has also added support for Dolby Vision HDR at 120Hz, which is currently only offered on the Xbox Series X. LG has also added a unique Game Optimizer menu, which gives you data about current frame rates and latency, and lets you adjust specific aspects of picture and processing such as black stabilizer, latency, VRR support and HDR settings. With our Xbox Series X connected, we could see that the TV supports 4K UHD gameplay at 60 Hz and 120 Hz, along with HDR 10 and Dolby Vision. In regular movie and TV playback, the TV sports 10-bit color at 24, 50 and 60 Hz. If the Xbox supports it, the LG C1 OLED supports it as well. And it all shows in actual gameplay. Getting a bird's-eye view in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, peering through the eyes of a raven, I was able to swoop over and around a highly detailed Norse village. The richly detailed world is full of vibrant colors, with decorative rooftops, realistic snowfall, and lots of birds flapping around. Back on ground level, interacting with other characters, I was pleased to see finely detailed fur and tooled leather, not to mention a great range of brightness thanks to HDR. From the basic responsiveness and picture quality to the fine-tuned features and format support, this TV is built to deliver a premium gaming experience. The end result is one of the best gaming TVs we've ever seen. The LG C1 OLED offers sound that's just as premium as the display. Equipped with 40 watts of 2.2 channel audio, the slim TV boasts better-than-average sound and volume. In my hands-on time with the TV, I was thrilled by the sound quality. When watching video, the accompanying dialog was clear and easy to understand. When listening to music from the new Netflix Cowboy Bebop soundtrack, I loved how well the TV brought out the funky kung-fu film-inspired bassline and conga drums in the track Blood Brothers, and the updated version of Tank! Was super clear when playing the blaring horns that might overwhelm the speakers on a lesser TV. But even quieter sounds come through clearly. Watching a 4K fireplace video, the crackles and pops of burning logs were crisp and clear, while the low rumble of the fire came through realistically. The one area where the TV didn't wow me was the bass quality. At volumes below 25%, the bass levels were lackluster, and too quiet to balance the rest of the sound. Conversely, when the volume was up higher, around 70%, bass not only got louder, it overpowered the treble more than it should. You could probably fix both of these issues in the equalizer settings, but the balance wasn't perfect under the default settings. Related to sound, the LG C1 OLED also has some extra features that are a cut above. The TV's Bluetooth connectivity means that you can pair it with Bluetooth speakers for easy surround sound, and WiSA connectivity delivers wireless 5.1 for WiSA-ready sound systems. Even on wired systems, Dolby Atmos support delivers immersive, multi-dimensional audio, which you can get through the best soundbars. There is one problem, however. Some users have complained that there's significant audio delay on LG OLED TVs when using Dolby Atmos with certain devices. For example, when gaming on Xbox Series X lip sync can feel off by a good 1-2 seconds, something that becomes grating. We hope that a fix is coming. LG's AI Sound Pro can also be used to optimize audio for the room and surroundings of the TV, adjusting the sound to better reflect off of nearby furniture and walls for a richer soundscape, even with no additional speakers. The LG C1 OLED has great smart TV functions, thanks largely to the improved webOS 6.0. The updated interface has a cleaner look, with multiple rows of apps and content suggestions, closer to the interface used by Google TV than the single ribbon menu of apps that older webOS versions used. It's smarter in some unusual ways, with features like Sports Alert, which lets you get updates on your favorite sports and individual teams, like start times for events and scores for ongoing matches, even while watching other content. LG's ThinQ AI combines intuitive content search with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice assistants, with both available right from the remote. LG's app selection is also better than it's ever been, with recent additions bringing services like Peloton and HBOmax. The app selection isn't the biggest of any smart TV platform we've seen, but it has most of the apps that people really want – but it's missing a few, like DIscovery+, Philo TV and several popular BBC apps (and even popular options like Apple TV+ have lagged months behind other TVs in getting support) so look up your must-have apps to make sure you can get it on webOS. One more cool thing for gamers: LG also has superb support for cloud gaming services. With both Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Cloud, it's a great gaming TV even if you don't have a game console or PC connected. LG's revamped Magic Remote is just as good as the last time we looked at it, which has a sleeker profile than in years past, making it more comfortable to hold in the hand than its bulbous predecessor. The scrolling click wheel in the center of the remote makes it easy to browse through menus and lists, while the motion controlled cursor on-screen gives you an intuitive way to navigate apps. Dedicated app buttons on the remote let you jump right to popular apps, like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and LG Channels, which offers a bunch of free content you can enjoy without any kind of sign up or subscription. The rest of the remote layout is pretty self-explanatory, with number buttons for jumping to specific channels, up and down buttons for adjusting volume and flipping channels, and buttons for opening menus or using both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. The LG C1 OLED is a superb TV, and in many respects, it's close to perfect. The picture quality is fantastic. The gaming performance and features are second to none. The sound quality needs a little tweaking to get it dialed in, but between AI optimization and adjustments for personal preference, it goes from good to great very quickly, and will deliver even better sound when paired with a great soundbar or speakers. LG' webOS is better than it's ever been, and when paired with the improved remote and dual-assistant voice control options, it's a deeply intuitive and powerful smart TV experience. You'll be hard pressed to find a better looking TV, but other elements, like the smart TV software, we've seen competitors edge slightly ahead. The Sony Bravia XR A80J OLED offers similar premium performance with Google TV (which is the best smart TV platform on the market right now), and the Samsung QN90A Neo QLED TV offers better brightness than OLED can match while going point for point on most features. But in terms of delivering a great total package, from the basics to the finer touches, the LG C1 OLED is definitely one of the best, and puts it all together at a premium price that matches the value you get. The Samsung and Sony models edge ahead in a few specific areas, but there's no doubt that this is one of the best sets on the market, and the best gaming TV you can buy."
24,5,CNET,8.7,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/lg-oled65c1pub-review/,"With a world-beating picture, oodles of features and slim styling, the LG C1 remains the TV to beat.","OLED TVs have the best picture quality available, and today there are more choices in OLED than ever. From the less expensive LG A1 and Vizio H1 to the wallet-busting Sony A90J and LG G1, high-end shoppers who've decided on an OLED TV face another tough decision: Which OLED TV, exactly? I haven't reviewed all of them, but from what I've seen so far, the best option for most buyers is the LG OLED C1. It combines that incredible image quality with the best features -- particularly for gamers -- the widest range of screen sizes and a price that's not too outrageous. I compared the C1 directly with its predecessor, the LG CX, as well as with a TCL 8K QLED TV with Mini-LED that costs about the same, and the C1 was my favorite. It and the CX were neck-and-neck for picture quality, but the C1 pulled away with its flexible gaming options. Meanwhile the Samsung QN90A QLED is brighter and in some ways superior, but overall the picture quality of the C1 is better. The C1 is also a lot more affordable than the LG G1, and image quality on those two 2021 OLEDs was basically the same. I haven't reviewed the Sony A80J yet, which currently costs a bit more than the C1, but I'd be surprised if it's significantly better. In short, if you want the superiority of OLED image quality, the LG C1 is my go-to pick for 2021. Series and size information: I performed a hands-on evaluation of the 65-inch OLED C1, but this review also applies to the other screen sizes in the series. All sizes have identical specs and according to the manufacturer should provide very similar picture quality. Click the links below to get pricing on this page appropriate for the size you're interested in. If you've seen any mainstream LG OLED TVs in the last couple of years, the C1's design will ring a bell. The watchword is ""minimalist,"" with a slim border around the screen on all four sides and a tiny, discreet LG logo. Seen from the side, the top two-thirds of the TV are blade-thin, while the bottom widens to accommodate the guts, inputs and other connections. The stand is basically the same as the CX from last year, running almost the whole width of the panel in the front and incorporating a very heavy base at the rear that kept my review sample admirably steady. One change is the color of the back: It's now a stark white, like some LG OLEDs of yesteryear. LG revamped the remote a bit. It kept my favorite features, namely the scroll wheel and motion-tracking, while slimming it down slightly. The biggest difference is the addition of shortcut keys at the bottom: four for streaming services and two more for the built-in voice assistants, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Both Google and Alexa can do all the usual assistant stuff, including control smart home devices, answer questions and respond via a voice coming out of the TV's speakers (yep, both voices). Basics like ""What's the weather?"" work as you'd expect, complete with onscreen feedback. The C1 also works with Apple's AirPlay 2 system, just like many other TVs, allowing my iPhone to share photos and video on the screen from the Photos app and mirror my Mac and phone screens. LG's WebOS menu system got a face-lift for 2021 -- and I'm not a fan. Gone is the small, unobtrusive overlay at the bottom of the screen that lets you keep tabs on what you're watching. Instead there's a full-screen homepage, similar to what you get with a Roku, Fire TV or Google TV. But it has fewer apps and more, well, junk. The top two-thirds of the screen are devoted to the weather, setup tips, a search window and a Trending Now section with a random collection of TV shows and movies. Below that is an app row and, farther down, sections devoted to inputs and particular streaming apps. In general it feels like a hodgepodge with too much going on -- most systems are simpler and easier to grasp. The C1 isn't missing anything I'd expect on a high-end TV. Aside from the Evo panel, the C1 has the same image quality features as the step-up G1, starting with the new Gen 4 a9 processing chip that adds scene detection and upgraded object enhancement over last year's version. Both the G1 and C1 also have a 120Hz refresh rate. The entry-level A1 OLEDs, meanwhile, have a more basic a7 processor and 60Hz refresh rate. Just like last year, LG's OLED TVs' picture settings include a Filmmaker Mode. As promised, it turns off the soap opera effect for film-based content (yay) but so do many other of the C1's modes. While plenty accurate, Filmmaker Mode is also relatively dim for standard dynamic range, so I ended up using Cinema and ISF Bright for most critical viewing. New for 2021 is a Game Optimizer menu with its own set of picture modes; see below for details. All of LG's recent OLED models (except the A1) include the latest version of the HDMI standard: 2.1. That means their HDMI ports can handle 4K at 120 frames per second and variable refresh rate (VRR, including Nvidia G-sync and AMD FreeSync), as well as enhanced audio return channel (eARC) and automatic low latency mode (auto game mode). In other words, they can take advantage of the latest graphics features available from PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S consoles as well as high-end graphics cards. In fact, the C1 is rare among high-end TVs in that all four of its HDMI ports support 4K/120 -- great for hard-core gamers with multiple next-gen devices. The selection of connections is otherwise top-notch, though it no longer supports analog component video. There's also a dedicated headphone or analog audio output and another for IR blasters, which could ease some installations. The C1 is a superb performer, every bit as capable as the best TVs I've reviewed. I wasn't able to compare it directly to the G1 for this review, but according to my measurements as well as my comparisons of both panels to the CX from 2020, the C1 and G1 have nearly identical image quality. The G1's Evo panel, as I mentioned in that review, doesn't deliver a major brightness advantage over other LG OLEDs, including the C1. In their favor, both 2021 OLEDs are excellent and the best-performing TVs I've reviewed, a hair above the CX. For this review I also compared the C1 with the best-performing LCD TV I had on hand, the TCL 65R648, which costs about the same as the C1 and happens to have 8K resolution. In case you're wondering, I saw no sharpness or resolution advantage with the 8K TCL compared with the 4K OLEDs when watching HD or 4K material. The TCL uses Mini-LED and full-array local dimming but doesn't perform quite as well as the Samsung Q90A, showing more blooming issues, for example. I didn't have the Samsung Q90A on hand to compare directly either, but it's still the best LCD-based TV I've reviewed. That said, based on my comparison with the G1, the Q90A would still fall short of the C1, which exhibited perfect black levels, excellent mixed-scene contrast and better off-angle viewing than any LCD I've tested. Dim lighting: As expected, the C1 was excellent in a dark room, but no better than the CX when watching cinematic material -- in this case The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King on standard 1080p Blu-ray. During the darker scenes when Frodo, Sam and Gollum travel toward Mordor, for example, the inky blackness of both OLED TVs surpassed the contrast of the TCL, which showed lighter, less realistic shadows and letterbox bars and some brightness variation (blooming) -- standard on just about every non-OLED TV. Shadow detail was also excellent on the C1, if again not any different from the CX. The shadowy stairs and crags of Cirith Ungol looked realistic, not too bright and yet well-detailed. Again the TCL trailed somewhat, with slightly more obscured shadows and a less theatrical look. Bright lighting: The C1 is plenty bright enough for just about any viewing environment, but as usual it's not nearly as bright as competing LCD-based models. Compared with other OLEDs it measured basically as bright as the G1, despite lacking the Neo panel, and slightly brighter than the CX, but the difference isn't huge and proved tough to discern in most program material. LG OLEDs of recent vintage have a setting called Peak Brightness that boosts the light output for SDR sources in Cinema and Expert modes, and it works very well. The idea is to increase brightness for daytime viewing environments while maintaining the superior color accuracy of those modes. As with most TVs, the brightest mode for HDR and SDR (Vivid on the C1) is horribly inaccurate. For the accurate color columns above on the C1, I used ISF Expert Bright (Peak Brightness: High) for SDR and Cinema mode for HDR. I recommend C1 owners do the same to get good color in bright rooms in particular, because the difference between Vivid and more accurate modes is slight. Note that with SDR you'll need to disable the Auto Energy Saving setting (Support > Energy Saving > Energy Saving Step > Off) to get full brightness. Like all OLED TVs, the C1 gets quite a bit dimmer than LCDs when showing full-screen white -- a hockey game, for example -- but even in those situations it's hardly dim. The C1's screen preserved black levels and reduced reflections very well, but no better than the CX. Color accuracy: No complaints here. According to measurements and my comparisons, the C1's color was excellent. During the Muster of Rohan, for example, the red and blue of the tents, the green of the grassy fields and the skin tones of King Theoden and Merry all looked natural and realistic. On the other hand, all of the TVs were quite accurate, to the extent that it was difficult to tell the difference. Video processing: LG goes to great lengths to tout the improvement of its processing every year, but watching various material in the best picture settings, the CX and C1 looked largely identical to me. Motion handling on the C1 is excellent and a touch better than the CX, however. Under TruMotion, the new Cinematic Movement setting (the default for Cinema mode) served up a 24-frame cadence with a very slight hint of smoothing, improving on last year's too-smooth Cinema Clear setting while preserving 600 lines of motion resolution. Those 24p purists who want no smoothing at all will opt for the Off position (the default for Filmmaker mode) and suffer the low motion resolution, while tweakers will appreciate the fine granularity of the User De-Judder mode to dial in the right amount of smoothness; anything set to four or lower introduced some judder to my eye, conveying a sense of film rather than soap opera effect. De-Blur settings of six or higher deliver the full 600 lines of motion resolution. User mode also opens up the OLED Motion Pro menu with three levels of black frame insertion that further improve motion resolution, with 800 lines in Low and a full 1,200 in Med and High. This last option introduces flicker, unfortunately, and all three are a bit dimmer than Off, but if blur really bugs you then they're worth experimenting with.One improvement over last year is that engaging OLED Motion Pro no longer totally crushes shadow detail -- it's a bit worse but still OK. Still, I'd choose to leave it off and sacrifice some motion resolution for maximum light output and shadow detail. Uniformity: Like all OLEDs I've tested, the C1 was exemplary in this area, with no significant brightness or color variations across the screen and nearly perfect image quality from off-angle. In very dark, full-field test patterns the edges did appear slightly dimmer than the middle, but that effect was invisible in any real program material I watched. Gaming:Like the G1, the C1's biggest upgrades over 2020 models cater to gamers, and together they helped the C1 become my new favorite TV for gaming. The new Game Optimizer is the name of both a picture mode and a full menu system. The latter offers all-new tweaks including four game genre modes: Standard, FPS mode (said to boost shadow detail), RPG mode (to boost contrast) and RTS mode (said to enhance mid-grayscale areas). There are also sliders labeled Black Stabilizer (for adjusting dark areas) and White Stabilizer (for bright areas), as well as the OLED Motion Pro setting described above (LG says it's particularly useful for games) and the Reduce Blue light setting (said to be easier on the eyes). The C1 supported all advanced video features from my Xbox Series X, as advertised, including 4K/120 and VRR. Since I reviewed the G1 in April, LG has added a new status screen that appears whenever you hit the settings button while in Game Optimizer mode. Clad in aggressive purple, it displays current frame rate, picture mode, status of VRR, low latency (to reduce input lag) and Black Stabilizer. It's a nice enhancement and an answer to Samsung's game bar -- I actually like it better because it shows more info -- and if you don't like it you can turn it off. The genre modes behaved similar to what I saw on the G1 and while playing my current game, Mass Effect 3 from the Legendary Edition, I preferred the look of Standard, which was a good balance of contrast and shadow visibility. FPS will probably cater well to gamers who want maximum shadow visibility, and the other settings allow you to dial it in to your heart's content. I really like having all these extra adjustment options in a dedicated menu, especially since the calibration screens built into many games often do an inadequate job -- having the ability to tweak particular scenes is great. Buried within Game Optimizer is another setting labeled ""Reduce input delay (input lag)"" with two options, Standard and Boost. The former, which is the default for any game, serves up an excellent lag number similar to past LG OLED models as well as the G1: just 13.1ms for both 1080p and 4K HDR sources. Engaging Boost cuts lag even further, to just under 10ms for both. The catch is that Boost is only available for 60Hz sources, so you can't use it with 120Hz games or VRR. And no, I don't think many humans would notice the extra 3ms of lag. HDR and 4K video:The C1 is a superb performer with HDR as well, and while it lacked the brightness of the TCL and other high-end LCDs, its overall image quality, contrast and pop were superior. Comparing the three TVs using the Spears and Munsil 4K HDR benchmark, the two LG OLEDs looked consistently better than the TCL in most scenes. The TCL was brighter, for example, in the clouds, snowfields and mountaintops, but in more mixed bright-and-dark scenes it appeared slightly washed out in comparison, which hurt its overall contrast. Meanwhile the C1 and CX looked vibrant and powerful, even with their slightly dimmer highlights, and shadows in particular, such as in the twilit forests and shaded rocks, looked more natural and realistic. As usual the OLEDs really pulled ahead in the difficult shots of objects, for example cacti, flowers and a honey dipper, against black backgrounds -- the black of the TCL was brighter with visible blooming near the objects, while the OLEDs' was basically perfect. Colors in flowers and bottles of dye also looked more vibrant on the OLEDs. All of that said, the C1 and CX were almost impossible to tell apart with the Spears benchmark. Spot measurements of the C1 revealed it was very slightly brighter in some highlights, like the hub of the Ferris wheel (4:52), but without my light meter I couldn't tell. Switching back to LOTR:ROTK on 4K Blu-ray, I saw an even greater advantage for OLED. The LGs outclassed the TCL in darker theatrical scenes, for example when Sam challenges Shelob. Their letterbox bars remained inky and true and their shadows appropriately dark, while the TCL's dark areas were lighter, in particular with high-contrast shots like Sam brandishing the Phial of Galadriel at the spider (1:50:18). Given the TCL's significant brightness advantage I expected its rendition of the Phial to measure brighter in comparison, but a spot measurement showed the TCL, C1 and CX were actually very close (422, 396 and 368 nits, respectively), again too close to discern without a meter. And stop me if you've heard this before, but I couldn't tell the difference between the CX and C1 when watching ROTK. Both were equally superb. CNET is no longer publishing advanced picture settings for any TVs we review. Instead, we'll give more general recommendations to get the best picture without listing the detailed white balance or color management system settings we may have used to calibrate the TV. As always, the settings provided are a guidepost, and if you want the most accurate picture you should get a professional calibration. Before my calibration for this review the Cinema preset was the most accurate, excellent in terms of grayscale and gamma. Since I now target a 2.2 gamma for my reviews in dark rooms, it was closer than ISF Expert Dark or the new Filmmaker modes, which both target gamma 2.4/BT 1886. ISF Bright was basically identical to Cinema, but I reserved that for brighter rooms. For my calibration I tweaked the two-point grayscale slightly, reduced light output to my target of 137 nits and increased brightness by two pips to help with shadow detail (while still keeping perfect black levels), but otherwise I left well enough alone. The grayscale and color were already so accurate on my LG-provided review sample that I didn't need to touch the multipoint system or the color management system. HDR notes:The two most accurate modes, HDR Cinema and Filmmaker mode, were basically identical, following the target electro-optical transfer function -- how the TV converts data to a specific brightness -- quite closely and showing better grayscale than Cinema Home, the next most accurate. Game Optimizer is best for gaming thanks to its processing, but quite blue; for the best color accuracy for gaming you should adjust the color temperature control all the way toward red (Color > White Balance > Color temperature > Warm50). Color checker was more accurate than on the CX from last year and as usual with OLED the C1 covered the P3 HDR gamut very well. The C1 measured basically as bright as the G1 and brighter than the CX or the B9 from 2019, but the C9 from 2019 actually measured brighter in its least-accurate and basically the same in its most-accurate settings. Once again the TV automatically detected and engaged the HDMI Ultra HD Deep Color setting designed for HDR sources."
25,5,Reviewed,5,https://www.reviewed.com/televisions/content/lg-c1-oled-tv-review,"From its incredible performance to its future-facing features, the LG C1 is easily one of the best TVs we’ve ever seen.","One notch down from LG’s Gallery OLED series—the annual crown jewel of LG’s TV lineup—sits the impressive “C” series, whose award-winning lineage includes the LG C8, the LG C9, and the LG CX, our favorite TV of 2020. This time around, the LG C1 (available at Amazon for $1,696.99) is taking up the mantle of LG’s vaunted “C” classification, and the number in its name might prove to be fitting, as the C1 is on pace for being our #1 TV of the year. In addition to its peak performance, its beautiful design, and its laundry list of extra features, the LG C1 is just a flat-out better value than this year’s LG Gallery OLED (known as the “G1”). In fact, when it comes to picture quality, I’d wager that most folks wouldn’t notice much of a difference between the two. The C1 is almost as good as the LG G1, but it’s also a better all-around package than most of the TVs we’ve tested, too. From its incredible performance to its future-facing features, the LG C1 is easily one of the best TVs we’ve ever seen. The LG C1 OLED is available in four sizes, which is one more than you’ll find in the LG G1 series, the C1's pricier, flashier older sibling. While both series offer 55-, 65-, and 77-inch models, the LG C1 also comes in a compact 48-inch version. This TV has also seen excellent sales since its initial release, and we expect that to continue as LG rolls out its 2022 lineup. As is the case with all OLED displays, the C1 does not rely on a backlight for illumination. Instead, each pixel in the display is self-illuminating. For this reason, we don’t expect there to be any difference in performance from one size to another. The C1 comes with webOS—the newest version of LG’s smart platform—pre-installed, along with a new iteration of the company’s motion-enabled Magic Remote. One thing to keep in mind is that the C1 doesn’t feature LG’s new “OLED Evo” panel technology. For that feature, you’ll have to pony up for the LG G1. As our review points out, however, it might not make a big enough difference for you to justify the up-charge. Before testing each TV, we make sure the panel is on and receiving a continuous signal for at least 24 hours, allowing the pixels plenty of time to warm up. Our 65-inch LG C1 received this standard warm-up time before any readings were taken. For SDR tests, we used LG’s “ISF Expert (Bright)” picture mode, and for HDR tests, we used LG’s “Cinema” picture mode. We’ve chosen these settings because of their accuracy, but results may vary depending on which picture mode is enabled. For example, you’re likely to experience a brighter picture on the TV’s “Vivid” picture mode, but this sacrifices color accuracy. To get a sense of the TV’s average performance, we use a standard ANSI checkerboard pattern for most of our basic contrast tests. We also use white and black windows ranging from 2% to 90% to test how well the contrast holds up while displaying varying degrees of brightness. Our peak brightness measurements are taken with sustained windows, so these figures represent the TV’s peak brightness over a sustained period of time. Specular highlights (like brief flashes of reflected light) might reach higher brightness levels, but not for a sustained period of time. Seeing an OLED TV in person for the first time is a magical moment. These impressive displays are capable of producing perfect black levels on account of their self-emissive nature, and since contrast is a cornerstone of picture quality, the benefits of OLED are immediately apparent. Like many LG OLEDs that came before it, the C1’s jaw-dropping contrast is its best quality. With perfect black levels, even the darkest scenes are draped in detail; shadow delineation is precise and, impressively, there’s almost no light bloom to speak of when bright picture elements meet darkness. When it comes to brightness, the LG C1 has plenty to offer, at least as far as OLEDs go. It joins the ranks of the Sony A90J and the LG G1 as one of the three brightest OLEDs we’ve ever tested, settling into the 700- to 800-nit range during HDR, just as those TVs did. These are measurements of sustained brightness, and you can expect to see a bit more “pop” for short-lived specular highlights (small reflections of light, for example). In fact, the LG C1’s overall contrast doesn’t look that much different than that of the LG G1, and as you’ll recall, one of the main draws of the G1 is supposed to be the TV’s “OLED Evo” panel, which LG dubbed “the second evolution of OLED TV.” The OLED Evo panel was reported to pack a brighter punch, and while it is somewhat brighter than the C1 on average, we don’t think most folks will notice a difference. Compared to the high-octane brightness of a quantum dot LED TV, an OLED TV’s performance is more restrained; it’s more subtle realism over dazzling psychedelia. You might find that, for some content, the vividness of a quantum dot LED TV is more desirable, but pound for pound, the C1’s picture is more dialed-in than all of the quantum dot LED TVs we’ve tested for 2021 (the best of which is the Samsung QN90A QLED TV). Almost as impressive as the C1’s contrast is its color production, which is among the best we’ve seen in 2021. SDR content (like cable TV, HD Blu-rays, and the majority of streaming content) looks great on the C1, as the TV is capable of 100% saturation of the SDR color standard (Rec.709). Even its out-of-the-box “ISF Expert” picture settings produce a nigh-perfect picture—no additional tinkering required. Content mastered for HDR (High Dynamic Range) is sure to blow you away, too; our lab tests indicate that the C1 is capable of covering 97% of the HDR color gamut (DCI-P3). It’s not quite as well-saturated as the LG G1, which covers roughly 99% of HDR color, but that might have something to do with the G1’s Evo panel, which uses new, altogether different materials and gets marginally brighter in HDR. Because the G1’s added brightness happens on the subpixel level, its benefits can be measured in color saturation, too, not just in overall picture luminance. That said, even the most discerning eye likely won’t be able to tell the difference between the G1 and the C1, all conditions being equal. Perhaps LG’s next evolution of OLED will outpace the company’s standard version of the technology, but from where we sit, the C1 is almost every bit as impressive from a performance standpoint as the more-premium LG G1. One of the benefits of investing in a TV of this caliber is the peace of mind of knowing that, for the most part, you’re probably going to be covered when it comes to the latest A/V formats and features. The LG C1 is no exception—it’s positively packed with extras to justify its premium cost. Let’s start with its various compatibilities. The C1 supports both Dolby Vision (the HDR format with the most stringent benchmarks) as well as HDR10. Gamers needn’t worry about the C1 facing obsoletion anytime soon, as it’s well equipped to support next-generation gaming for the foreseeable future. It supports both Auto Low Latency Mode (which automatically switches the C1 into its gaming mode when a console is detected) as well as Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), which prevents screen tearing and other visual artifacts during gameplay (you can read more about VRR and ALLM in our guide). In addition, the C1 offers a refresh rate of 120Hz and supports video at 120 frames per second (fps) in 4K resolution across all of its HDMI ports. Simply put, the C1 is one of the best TVs you can pair with an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5. Like other LG TVs for 2021, the C1 puts all of its gaming-related settings right at the user’s fingertips with a feature the company refers to as “Game Optimizer.” Rather than bury all of the various gaming settings in separate submenus, Game Optimizer puts them all in one place that can be easily accessed at any time. From the Game Optimizer menu, you’ll find most of the TV’s motion enhancement settings, as well as various picture presets for different genres of games (RPG, FPS, and RTS). There’s also a toggle switch in the Game Optimizer menu that reduces blue light in order to curb eye strain. While we’re just beginning to take some of Game Optimizer’s finely tuned controls out for a spin, it really is a breath of fresh air to have all of these options in one place, just a few clicks away. The C1 comes with the latest iteration of webOS in tow, and it looks a bit different this year. Rather than cordoning off the entire app menu to a bar at the bottom of the screen like previous versions, the newest iteration puts all of the platform’s navigational experience on its own home screen—more in line with its contemporaries. Some folks might understandably find the shift to be jarring, but I don’t expect this response from those who’ve never used webOS before. We found the new webOS experience to be just fine, with easy-to-navigate menus and zippy response times. If you’re still wary about webOS, you could always replace it with an external streaming device. Once you get past its jaw-dropping contrast, the second thing you’ll likely notice about any given OLED TV is its thin, futuristic design. Since they first hit the shelves several years back, LG OLEDs have earned a reputation for being particularly pretty, what with their razor-thin profile and elegant stand design. The C1 continues this fine tradition with an elegant, thoughtful profile that’s sure to do your living room proud. Even the thickest part of its panel (where its internals are housed) is narrow compared to most backlit LED TVs, and at its thinnest, the C1’s panel is no thicker than a smartphone. The panel is cradled by a textured, silver slab that acts as its stand, with most of the anchoring being done behind the scenes around the back of the TV. From the front, it looks as though this slightly curved slab is gently lifting the C1 up off its surface. Despite not calling attention to itself, I can’t help but admire it. OLED TVs have come a long way in the brightness department but still pale in comparison to their souped-up, quantum dot-enhanced LED competitors. While traditional LCD/LED TVs aren’t capable of producing perfect black levels, OLEDs aren’t equipped to reach the sky-high brightness levels of high-end LED TVs like the Samsung QN90A. To be fair, the C1 is plenty bright for all but the brightest viewing conditions. And if OLED is what you’re after, the C1, G1, and Sony A90J represent the brightest options in this class (with the G1 and A90J eclipsing the C1 ever so slightly). The C1 is the most affordable of these three, which makes it an attractive choice, but if your living room gets its fair share of sunlight, you might be better off shopping for an LED TV. Though more affordable than the stupendously pricey G1, the C1 is nevertheless on the upper end of the spectrum of TV prices in 2021. To be fair, it justifies its cost by being one of the best-performing TVs we’ve ever tested and by offering an array of cutting-edge features that will keep the C1 near the top of its class for years to come. Still, its price tag is a tough pill to swallow. For as much as these incredible TVs have come down in price over the last few years, there’s still a sizable gap between the cost of the LG C1 and most second-tier flagship TVs. If you can’t bring yourself to invest in a 55- or 65-inch C1, one option at your disposal is to go for the 48-inch model, whose $1,500 price tag is much easier to digest. It’s a bit smaller, but it’s a nice option to have in your back pocket if you want a taste of the OLED lifestyle. After our initial review, we discovered something we didn't expect: LG has dropped support for DTS in its TVs made after 2020. This means that, if you have a large Blu-ray collection with DTS tracks, you'll need to plug your player into an A/V receiver or supported soundbar to decode the full audio track, rather than your TV directly. Since we expect most folks with this kind of setup to have a properly dedicated audio device anyway, we don't think this will be much of an issue for most prospective buyers (LG obviously didn't). But it's something to note if Blu-ray is your preferred video experience. From what we’ve seen so far this year, the only TVs that match the LG C1 in features and eclipse it in performance are the LG G1 and the Sony A90J, but both of these OLED class competitors are only marginally better despite costing significantly more. And, in the case of the LG G1, you’ll need to buy a stand separately (for another $100) if you’re not planning on wall-mounting it. For that reason, we think the C1 is a better choice for most folks than the G1 or the Sony A90J. All three are incredible, but only the C1 carries a price that, while steep, won’t make you faint. Plus, while both of its closest competitors are offered in three larger sizes, the C1 is the only one of the trio that’s available in a relatively affordable, 48-inch variant. If you’re angling for a TV with blisteringly high brightness levels, we recommend taking a look at the Samsung QN90A, a high-end quantum dot TV that packs a bright, colorful punch, despite not matching the C1 in every other performance category. It’s still early in the year, but it’s hard to see another TV coming along that performs as well as the LG C1 without costing far more. It’s one of the best TVs we’ve ever tested, and carries on in the award-winning tradition of previous LG OLED TVs that wear the company’s “C” emblem."

27,6,Techradar,5,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-g1-oled-tv,The LG G1 Gallery OLED turns things up to 11,"The way the LG G1 OLED combines a bit more brightness with OLED’s renowned black level and local contrast prowess – without, so it’s claimed, increasing the chance of OLED screen burn – makes the LG G1 OLED easily the best OLED TV LG has ever made. And given the quality of LG’s previous OLED TVs, that’s really saying something. The LG G1 OLED is the follow up to the sleek Gallery OLED model that debuted last year, but a host of improvements – including a shot in the arm to brightness – make the G Series a more tempting proposition than ever.Adding a new high-efficiency ‘Evo’ panel design and enhanced colour system allows the G1 OLED series to boldly go where no LG OLED has gone before. It means, after all, that the spectacular black level and local contrast talents that LG OLED TVs have always boasted can be partnered with more of the raw brightness and colour reach that’s so important to a true HDR experience.The extent of the brightness and colour boost is not all that extreme, to be clear. As the Evo name for the new panel technology suggests, it’s still perhaps more of an evolution than a flat-out revolution (and the same technology coming to the Sony A90J and other competing flagships reduces some of the novelty). But the difference is certainly noticeable and emphatically welcome, making the LG G1 OLED a real standout set in today’s market. It’s backed up, too, by a big improvement to LG’s AI Picture Pro video processing, and support across all four HDMIs for all the big new 4K, HDR, VRR and 120Hz gaming graphics features. The LG G1 OLED’s thin, uniform design helps it look gorgeous on your wall, too, and while there are some teething troubles with the revamped webOS operating system, once you’ve grown accustomed to it, it can still be an effective, content-rich smart platform.UPDATE: LG’s gaming TVs have had an upgrade, including the LG G1 OLED we’re reviewing here. Both the LG C1 and LG G1 OLED TVs now support Dolby Vision HDR at 4K/120Hz, after the latest firmware update for these 2021 OLED screens, and it spells good news for gamers.Firmware version 03.15.27 is now available, we're told, making the two flagship 2021 LG OLEDs the first TVs in the world to support Dolby Vision HDR at such a high specification."
28,6,CNET,8.4,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/lg-oled65g1pua-review/,"This high-end TV offers the best image quality yet, but not by much.","For years OLED TVs have delivered the best image quality available with display technology that has remained largely unchanged, but LG promised something even better for 2021. The G1 has an all-new panel not available on any other TV LG sells. The company calls it Evo and says it achieves higher brightness and improved color. My verdict? Yes, it's slightly better than before but even in a side-by-side comparison, it was difficult to tell the difference. I set up the G1 next to the CX, the best TV I reviewed in 2020, measured both and watched a variety of TV shows, movies and games. The G1 was indeed a bit brighter than the CX but color was nearly identical, as were other aspects of picture quality like video processing and uniformity. Both looked spectacular, however, and in most material I really couldn't say one looked better than the other. The main advantage the G1 has over the CX and pretty much every other OLED TV is its unique design. This TV is made to be wall-mounted -- quite literally; it doesn't even come with a stand! If you want to put it on a piece of furniture, as shown in the images in this review, you'll have to pay $100 extra for LG's little side legs. And that would be a shame, because something this thin should really be on a wall. New for 2021 LG has improved its already best-in-class gaming features by adding picture modes especially for games, as well as a convenient menu that shows all gaming info and adjustments in one place. There's a new remote and a new smart TV homepage, too. The more affordable C1 shares those features with the G1, however. At this point, the G1 is the best TV I've ever tested -- by a nose. I have yet to review its competitor from Sony, the A90J, which also promises a brighter panel, or any other high-end TVs like Samsung's Neo QLED models, so that title might not last. But for people who don't have money to burn, the extra picture quality of the G1 probably isn't worth the extra money over mainstream OLED models like the CX or C1. A TV doesn't get any more minimalist than this. Like many sets these days the G1 is pretty much all picture when seen from the front, but it's the side view that sets it apart. It measures just 0.8 inches deep and is designed for nearly flush wall-mounting. And as I mentioned at the top, it doesn't even come with a tabletop stand: If you want a stand mount, it will cost $100 extra. This TV's design is wasted if you don't wall-mount it. LG includes a custom bracket in the box and instructions that make it easy to slap up yourself if you're at all handy -- although I'm guessing most people in this price bracket will hire somebody to do the job. Thanks to an inset on the back of the TV the wall mount doesn't add any extra depth, allowing the G1 to hug the wall and present a very slim profile. Channels are built into the TV's back to run cables through, for a cleaner installation behind the TV. LG recommends using molding to hide cables on the wall itself. Note: I didn't mount it myself in my test basement, but I've mounted plenty of TVs before and this one seems like it would be a simple job. LG revamped the remote a bit. It kept my favorite features, namely the scroll wheel and motion-tracking, while slimming it down slightly. The biggest difference is the shortcut keys at the bottom: four for streaming services and two more for the built-in voice assistants, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. The former wasn't yet available on my G1 review sample, but LG says it will be soon. The G1 is also equipped with a far-field mic (not available on the C1) so you can simply say the wake word to get the TV to respond, no remote required. It responded just like I'd expect from a smart speaker to my ""Alexa"" commands."
29,6,Tom's guide,4,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/lg-g1-oled-tv,Does the first LG OLED evo TV deliver on all its promises?,"Although OLED technology already offered the best TV performance around, LG looked to elevate its lineup’s standards this year. The LG G1 OLED TV features an all-new panel called ‘evo,’ advertising a brighter image and better color range than existing OLED screens.Compared to the LG GX OLED TV, one of the sleekest sets I reviewed last year, the G1’s upgrades feel more exclusive. Rather than outfit the same panel in its top and second-tier sets, LG reserved evo for its ultra-thin Gallery Series. (That combination won it a 2021 Tom's Guide Award for best TV design!) You’ll get the latest webOS version, redesigned remote and Gen 4 a9 processor on all the LG 2021 TVs, a flush-mount design is no longer the only thing the G series holds over the rest.Better yet, the 65-inch model I tested for this LG G1 OLED TV review costs $500 less than the 65-inch LG GX OLED did when it first came out. It's the best 4K TVs LG makes right now, and one of the best OLED TVs on the market. But is the promise of a lower price for a more advanced panel too good to be true? Let’s find out."
30,6,Whathifi,5,https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/lg-oled65g1,Is LG’s new 'OLED Evo' panel all it’s cracked up to be?,"For the last few years, the C-class model has been the sensible choice of each new LG OLED range. Until now, it has been the most affordable model with the latest panel and picture processing tech: go further up the range and you might get better sound and a fancier design, but you won’t get a better visual performance. Somewhat disappointingly, that’s not the case this year. For 2021, LG has introduced a new ‘OLED Evo’ panel that promises increased brightness and sharpness, and to get the Evo panel you have to step up to the G1. That’s slightly disappointing because you also end up paying extra for a rather niche design that you may not want. It won’t be possible to make a final judgment on the value of the Evo panel until we’ve also tested the non-Evo C1, but the G1 is without a doubt the best LG OLED we’ve tested so far. On the subject of streaming services, LG has sensibly re-partnered with Freeview Play for its 2021 TVs. The two companies took a Ross and Rachel-style break from one another in 2020, leaving that year’s LG TVs without any of the UK’s core catch-up apps at launch. Even now, last year’s TVs are missing All 4 and My5."
31,7,RTINGS,8.8,https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/sony/a80j-oled,"It sits below the Sony A90J OLED in Sony's 2021 lineup, and although there are a few drawbacks compared to the higher-end model, like worse HDR peak brightness, it still delivers stunning picture quality, especially in dark rooms.","The Sony A80J is excellent overall. It's fantastic for watching movies in dark rooms because it has a near-infinite contrast ratio that produces deep blacks, and there's no blooming around bright objects. HDR content looks amazing because of its deep blacks, and it displays a wide color gamut, but its HDR brightness is just okay. It's also excellent for watching sports due to its near-instantaneous response time, and it's fantastic for gaming as it has HDMI 2.1 inputs. It's impressive to use as a PC monitor, but you risk damaging the screen with burn-in after exposure to static elements. The Sony A80J is a fantastic TV for watching movies in a dark room. It can display perfect blacks with no blooming thanks to its near-infinite contrast ratio, ideal for watching movies in a dark room. It also has no problems upscaling lower resolution content, and it removes 24p judder from any source. Due to its fast response time, however, low frame rate content appears to stutter. The Sony A80J is great for watching TV shows in a bright room. It upscales lower resolution content well, and it has wide viewing angles, so the image stays accurate from the sides. It also has a semi-gloss finish with incredible reflection handling, meaning glare won't be an issue in a room with a few lights around, but it's not bright enough to fight intense glare, like if you place the TV opposite a window with direct sunlight. The Sony A80J is excellent for watching sports. It has a near-instantaneous response time, so fast-moving sports look exceptionally clear. It also has wide viewing angles, which is great for watching with a group, and there's almost no dirty screen effect in the center. Unfortunately, its brightness is just okay, so it struggles with very intense light sources, but it still has fantastic reflection handling if you have some lights in the room."
32,7,avforums,9,https://www.avforums.com/reviews/sony-a80j-xr-65a80j-4k-oled-tv-review.19352/,"If you are looking for an accurate OLED TV for movie viewing and can’t quite stretch to the A90J or similar panels with the extra brightness, the Sony A80J makes a very strong case for movie fans with excellent picture quality and comes highly recommended for those reasons.","This may be Sony’s step-down OLED model for 2021, sitting just below the flagship A90J, but it certainly doesn’t mean a step down in overall performance. Apart from losing the aluminium laminate heatsink that resides within the A90J, the A80J keeps most of the other features found on its big brother and it competes in the same areas of the market as the Philips OLED806, Panasonic JZ1000 and LG C1 OLED TVs. The A80J is available in screen sizes of 55-, 65- and 77-inches and as the new Bravia XR models are announced for 2022 this week (January 2022) at CES in Las Vegas, the A80J should become a bit of a bargain should you decide it has all the features you want and you’re not tempted to wait for the new replacement model. Where the A90J sports XR OLED Contrast Pro, the A80J drops the 'pro' element (the heatsink) but retains the Cognitive Processor XR which helps to boost colours and brightness naturally, as well as picking out details and objects to make them feel more real based on how humans see things, as the Sony marketing puts it. So, while peak brightness will not be quite as high on the A80J, the HDR and SDR image quality should still benefit greatly from the image processing, which Sony has always done well.The A80J also benefits from XR Triluminos Pro colour thanks to the processor which means that the TV should be able to cover the DCI-P3 wide colour space well with good saturation tracking and brightness. Sony TVs usually have excellent colour reproduction thanks to the company’s rich heritage in producing some of the best professional grading monitors for the film and TV industry and this translates to accurate colours on its consumer models."
33,7,INSIDER,4,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/sony-a80j-oled-4k-tv-review,Sony's A80J OLED is the best 4K TV you can buy if you want top picture quality,"Sony's OLED displays are known for their incredibly accurate images and stunning contrast. Its most recent model, the A80J, has taken the company's lineup even further with an advanced image processor, HDMI 2.1 ports, and an adjustable stand. As a high-end 4K TV, the A80J OLED excels on nearly every level, delivering the premium quality buyers expect from a display of this class. Though OLEDs from LG and Vizio offer similar image capabilities, Sony's display edges out the competition when it comes to pure picture performance. That said, the differences are subtle, and the benefits here will largely appeal to big home theater enthusiasts who crave the absolute best movie-watching performance. The A80J also has some minor issues when it comes to smart TV navigation, and its gaming support isn't as robust as it could be. After spending several weeks with the TV, however, it's hard to nitpick the A80J's shortcomings. Simply put, this is the OLED to buy if you want the best image quality."

The A80J is a high-end OLED display that is the more approachable of Sony’s OLED lineup in terms of price and competes right up next to the LG C1 as one of the best 4K TVs for gaming. And while LG comes in just slightly less expensive, the A80J makes several strong arguments that it should be considered the superior choice side-by-side. Since the actual quality of the OLED panel is going to be negligibly different, if at all, Sony instead competes on its software and design. But is that worth the extra $200 when you’re already spending more than $2,000? Like most modern OLED televisions, the actual display of the Sony is stunningly thin. The bezels are near invisible, and Sony created a stand that sits the A80J just barely above my media console. Sony chose this particular design philosophy to bring as much emphasis on the display itself and make the other parts of the television fade into the background. When watching the A80J, I can attest that while I like the innovation of some stands on competitor displays – like the dramatic swoop found on the Vizio OLED – forcing my eye to just enjoy what’s on display with no distractions does make sense. Stands can look cool, but that’s not why I buy a television. The Sony A80J uses an OLED display, which means that each pixel of the television can be controlled individually and even turned off entirely. That means that blacks can be true black, which makes for stunning picture quality when contrasted against any pixels that are lit."
35,7,expertreviews,5,https://www.expertreviews.co.uk/sony/1415560/sony-a80j-review,The Sony A80J is a mid-range marvel that delivers great pictures and extensive features at an affordable price,"The Sony A80J is the mid-range model in the company’s 2021 OLED lineup, and while it doesn’t include the brighter XR Contrast Pro panel found on the high-end Master Series A90J, it’s powered by the same super-smart Cognitive Processor XR chip. In addition to various Sony-specific picture and sound enhancement technologies, there’s support for Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and IMAX Enhanced, alongside two HDMI 2.1 inputs with a host of next-gen gaming capabilities. All of which makes this stylishly designed and attractively priced OLED TV a real winner. The Sony A80J is a 4K (3,840 x 2,160) HDR smart OLED TV that incorporates the company’s new Cognitive Processor XR and Acoustic Surface Pro+ sound system. You can buy the A80J in 55in, 65in and 77in screen sizes, and for this review, Sony has provided a Sony A80J 55in, also known as the XR-55A80J. The Sony A80J has enjoyed some significant price reductions since its launch and the 55in model can now be picked up for just £1,299. That’s a great price for a mid-range model that’s bursting at the seams with cutting-edge tech and features. If you fancy something bigger, retailers are asking £1,799 for the 65in model, and a surprisingly reasonable £2,999 for the massive 77in version. The Sony A80J proves the company hasn’t lost its touch when it comes to designing a smart-looking TV, with this mid-range beauty using a flush metal bezel that’s barely visible and an understated matte black finish on the edges and rear panel. The 55in A80J measures 1,227 x 53 x 712mm (WDH) and weighs 17.8kg without its stand, and overall build quality is really rather impressive."

Like other OLEDs, it delivers unparalleled picture quality thanks to its self-emitting pixels, which produce perfect blacks and a near-infinite contrast ratio. While its HDR brightness is only decent relative to LED TVs, it still delivers a great HDR experience thanks to its wide color gamut and high contrast ratio. It also has a near-instantaneous response time for clear motion, and it supports variable refresh rate (VRR) technology to reduce screen tearing, but it doesn't support FreeSync. On the upside, it has two HDMI 2.1 ports, eARC, and Dolby Vision support. It also has wide viewing angles and superb reflection handling. As with all OLEDs, there’s some risk of permanent burn-in, but we don’t expect it to be an issue if you watch varied content. The Sony A90J is an amazing TV for mixed usage. It delivers exceptional picture quality for movies and TV shows, and its near-instantaneous response time results in smooth motion for sports and video games. While it doesn't get as bright as an LED TV, it's bright enough to bring out most highlights in HDR, aided by its near-infinite contrast ratio. Unfortunately, there's a risk for permanent burn-in, though it shouldn't be an issue if you watch varied content. The Sony A90J is a fantastic choice for watching movies. With its near-infinite contrast ratio, it can produce deep, inky blacks with perfect uniformity. It has no issues upscaling lower resolution content, like DVDs or Blu-rays, and it removes 24p judder from any source. Unfortunately, the extremely quick response time can cause stuttering in lower frame rate content like movies."
37,8,Techradar,5,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-a90j-oled-tv,"The Sony A90J is far from the most affordable OLED TV around, but you absolutely get what you pay for.","Sony certainly hasn’t held back in pricing its new A90J 4K HDR OLED TV – but this 55-inch version most certainly has the performance to justify the price. Picture quality, from any source, is about as good as it currently gets from 4K screens. In every meaningful department – motion control, contrast, edge definition, detail levels, you name it – the XR-55A90J puts in a memorably accomplished shift. And for those moments when you’re reduced to watching sub-4K content, it’s a really adept upscaler too. The Sony A90J OLED is more than a few steps ahead when it comes to sound quality, too. Using the entire surface of the screen as a speaker is still novel and effective, and backing it up with two conventional bass drivers means the XR-55A90J sounds fuller, more direct and just, well, better than any alternative that doesn’t feature an off-board sound system. The Sony XR-A90J range of OLED TVs is on sale now. It’s available in 65-inch ($3,799 / £3,499 / AU$4,999) and whopping 83-inch ($7,999 / £6,999) versions, while the 55-inch version we’re testing here will set you back $2,799 / £2,699. This is, no two ways about it, a premium price when you consider (for instance) the LG C1 we called “the current king of TVs” will set you back $1,799 / £1,699 / AU$3,499 for the 55-inch model. Only the 65-inch pricing is confirmed in Australia for now. Viewed head-on, the Sony A90J OLED is exactly what you want and expect from an expensive new TV: next-to-no bezel intrusion and an awful lot of screen. The Sony A90J is an interesting case, because as well as being wall-mountable it also features feet that work in a couple of positions. They can either leave the bottom of the screen near-flush against the surface it’s standing on (although it’ll need to be a wide surface, as in the instance the feet are actually beyond the edges of the frame), or they can lift the screen high enough to fit a soundbar beneath it."
38,8,CNN,5,https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/sony-a90j-oled-tv,"The Sony A90J is our pick for a luxury TV, offering the best picture currently available. It’s a high price to pay, but we think it’s worth it for all the advantages of an OLED panel paired with highly detailed, immersive visuals.","Sony’s A90J OLED TV is an expensive option that delivers the best picture of any TV we’ve tested. It’s been our luxury pick since it hit the market in spring of 2021, and still offers an excellent picture in a striking design with solid sound and a Google TV smart interface. So, what makes this TV worth a starting price of $2,798? Whip out the popcorn, take a seat on the couch and we’ll give you the lowdown. Who this is for: Sony’s A90J offers stunning picture quality in a strikingly thin design — all for an ultra-premium price. For the cost, you’ll get a terrific OLED panel, solid sound and plenty of smarts. What you need to know: The A90J is an OLED TV. And though this technology has historically struggled to impress with overall brightness, Sony flips the switch with this improved panel, delivering more vibrant colors. It’s the best picture we’ve tested and still looks great in a room with natural light. In addition, a built-in Google TV smart interface lets you easily stream from the main services, though like most flat TVs, the internal speakers offer decidedly average sound. How this compares: The Sony A90J trumps any TV we’ve previously tested in terms of picture quality, ensuring any content you watch (720p, 1080p or 4K) looks dynamite. Here you’ll find hyper-accurate colors, fine-tuned details and an immersive picture. Of course, at this price, it’s not for everyone. Those who don’t need the absolute best picture will be better suited with the TCL 6-Series. Smarts-wise, the Google TV interface is on par with others on the market and allows you to ask for content through the Google Assistant, much like the latest Chromecast. And although the speakers are about as good as you can get in a thin panel, we suggest considering a stand-alone soundbar. As an OLED TV, the Sony A90J emits and creates an image through individual pixels, which are not only responsible for visuals but also for the brightness in any given scene. Additionally, it can turn off individual pixels to make darker scenes look exceptionally dark. Unlike QLED or LED technologies, which allow LED lights to filter through a backlit panel to create an image, OLEDs typically offer more accurate colors — and have taken top spots in homes, apartments or spaces where lighting could be controlled."

Despite not being as philosophically predisposed to see OLED as innately superior to LCD as many rival brands, Sony has still turned out some of the best OLED TVs of recent years. The brand’s ever-impressive picture processing has consistently played very nicely with OLED’s pixel-by-pixel lighting. The only little consistent niggle I’ve had with Sony’s mostly excellent OLEDs is that they have tended to be a bit cautious with their brightness. Cue much excitement at the arrival of Sony’s new A90J range. These new flagship sets are Sony’s first to feature new high-brightness OLED panel technology, which use new manufacturing materials and, in Sony’s case, a laminated aluminium heat sink to solve the overheating issue that’s typically such a big factor in limiting OLED brightness. Sony is not the only brand to offer such technology, though. Panasonic has been selling very premium (see: expensive) high-brightness OLED panels for a couple of years now (including the new Panasonic JZ2000), and LG has introduced new brightness boosting panels on its 2021 LG G1 series. The idea of what Sony might be able to coax out of its new panels with the assistance of its new Bravia XR processor, though, is pretty mouthwatering. And the set delivers – this is absolutely one of the best TVs of 2021, and take Sony's OLEDs to whole new level (and they were pretty damn great before)."

But while most core components are carried over from one size to another, many aren’t – most notably the panel. LCD/LED models are the most prone to variation – a 49-inch panel will likely have different specs to a 650-inch one and may even be made by a different manufacturer – but OLED TVs aren’t immune either. Audio quality tends to vary with size, too, as a bigger chassis typically results in a fuller sound. What’s more, even if a TV did perform identically at each size it was available, its value against same-size rivals would likely differ which, as we review on a performance-per-pound basis, could affect our judgment. That’s why at What Hi-Fi? we test each model in as many sizes as we can. And so, having been blown away by the 55-inch version, we’re eager to follow up with the 65-inch Sony XR-65A90J. It’s hard to make a modern TV stand out from the crowd. The move to slimmer sets and ever-thinner bezels leaves little room for creativity. Even logos are at threat of extinction, although Sony has managed to squeeze a subtle one into the bottom-left corner of the A90J’s frame."

Like its predecessor, it delivers impressive performance and good value for its price, competing against high-end models from other brands like the Sony X90J and the Samsung QN90A QLED. Overall, it performs very similarly to the H9G, but there are a few welcome improvements, like two HDMI 2.1 ports, as well as a significantly improved color gamut. This TV delivers impressive peak brightness, outstanding contrast, a great local dimming feature, excellent reflection handling, and a wide color gamut. It's a great gaming TV with low input lag, a fast response time, and great gaming features. Unfortunately, while some of the issues found on the H9G have been fixed, others are still present, and these could be deal-breakers for some people. Overall, the Hisense U8G is an impressive TV. Thanks to its excellent contrast ratio, high peak brightness, and great local dimming feature, it's a great choice for watching SDR or HDR movies. Performance-wise, it has outstanding low input lag, excellent response time, and great gaming features like variable refresh rate (VRR), making it an excellent choice for gaming or use as a PC monitor. There are a few technical issues that might bother some people, but overall, it's a well-rounded TV that should please most people. The Hisense U8G is an excellent choice for watching movies in a dark room; the impressive contrast ratio, great local dimming, and excellent black uniformity deliver an impressive viewing experience in a dark room. Blu-ray and UHD Blu-ray content displays without any noticeable issues, and even older DVD or cable content looks great. Due to the fast response time, you might notice some stutter when watching movies, especially in slow panning shots. There's a motion interpolation feature that can help reduce the amount of stutter, but this introduces the soap opera effect, so it's not a perfect solution.The Hisense U8G is a great TV for watching sports, with some notable exceptions. It has excellent reflection handling and great peak brightness, so glare shouldn't be an issue for most people. It has a fast response time in brighter scenes, so the players look like players and not just a blurry shape on the screen. Lower resolution content, like cable sports, is upscaled well and looks almost as good as native 4k content. On the other hand, the image degrades when viewed at an angle, so if you like to watch the big game with a large group of friends, only those seated directly in front of the TV will enjoy it to the fullest."
42,9,CNET,7.9,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/hisense-u8g-tv-series-review/,"Searing light output is great for HDR and bright rooms, but it's not the whole story.","If you've been shopping for a new TV recently, you might have noticed a trend: They're getting brighter. TV makers are racing to build eye-watering displays that literally outshine rivals on the sales floor, and with the increasing availability of high dynamic range TV shows, movies and games, that brightness is an asset. The Hisense U8G belts out more raw brightness than just about any I've reviewed, which is more impressive considering its midrange price. TVs this bright, like the Samsung Q90A and Vizio PX, usually cost a lot more than the U8G. Meanwhile TVs at a similar price, including the TCL 6-Series and Sony X90J, measure significantly dimmer -- and the Hisense looked better with bright HDR material than those two in my side-by-side comparisons. That extra brightness also comes in handy in bright rooms. On the other hand, the Hisense's HDR performance was hampered by stray illumination and blooming, as well as lighter (worse) black levels in mixed-brightness and darker video. Beyond image quality the Hisense has its good points (sleek styling, especially that stand) and less-good (Android TV instead of the newer Google TV), but the main reason to consider this TV is if you have an exceedingly bright room or you want that extra punch when watching HDR content. I liked the image quality of the TCL and Sony better, but the U8G is a solid performer in its own right. Most TV series at this level include a 75-inch model, and perhaps a 50- or an 85-inch as well, but the U8G is only available in two sizes. I reviewed the 65-inch version, but this review applies to the 55-inch as well. Most TVs look pretty much the same, but the Hisense U8G stands out (pun intended). Its curvy and flowing stand reminds me of butterfly wings and looks like no other TV stand on the market. The frame around the picture is a dark, silver-gray metal along the bottom and beveled on the edges. The panel is surrounded by a thin strip of black on the top and sides, set against the same silver-gray, which also matches the stand. Unfortunately Hisense's remote spoils the high-end feel. It's a standard black, rubber-buttoned clicker with no fewer than six shortcut keys -- the usual suspects and, for some reason, Tubi. Another button summons Google Assistant, which you can talk to via remote or by saying ""OK Google"" into thin air, thanks to the U8G's built-in far-field mic. One misstep for the U8G is that it runs the Android's smart TV system instead of the more up-to-date Google TV platform, which is available from rivals including Sony and TCL. When I asked whether new TVs would be upgraded to Google TV, Hisense's rep told me, ""The 2021 lineup will continue using the Android TV operating system."" I don't expect an upgrade anytime soon. Android fragmentation, welcome to TVs. Android TV worked well enough on my U8G review sample, with snappy response times and the expected thousands of apps thanks to the Google Play store -- including 4K HDR and Dolby Vision from compatible apps like Netflix and Disney Plus. The homepage isn't my favorite -- it seems too cluttered with suggested material, too little of which I'm interested in (see also: ""Tik Toks That Are Actually Relatable"") -- but I appreciated being able to select favorite apps to add to the top for easy access. Overall I prefer Android TV to LG or Vizio, and it has more apps than Samsung, but Google TV and Roku are better in my book. The best picture-affecting extra on the U8G is full-array local dimming, a feature that illuminates different areas of the screen independently for better contrast. The 65-inch U8G I reviewed has a healthy 360 dimming zones, compared to 160 on the TCL 6-Series and 144 on the 2021 Vizio P-Series. In theory, more zones means better picture quality because they can better control illumination and blooming, but that's not always the case. It's also notable that unlike TCL, Samsung and LG, the U8G doesn't use mini-LED. Other picture-centric extras include a native 120Hz refresh rate to improve motion handling and gaming. The U8G supports all the major HDR formats, including Dolby Vision. Like Samsung, TCL and Vizio, Hisense uses quantum dots to achieve a wide HDR color gamut, but it uses its own ""ULED"" marketing label (it stands for ""ultra LED"" if you're asking) instead of the QLED marketing label. You should ignore them both. The U8G input selection matches up well against any high-end TV. The first two HDMI inputs are basic HDMI 2.0 while Input 3 and 4 work with the major HDMI 2.1 features, namely 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second and VRR (variable refresh rate) -- great news for gamers who want to take advantage of those features on an Xbox Series X or Sony PlayStation 5. The TV also supports enhanced audio return channel (eARC) on Input 3. Unlike many of Samsung's and LG's sets, the Hisense actually has an analog video input, albeit composite-only, and I also appreciate having a headphone jack. I set the Hisense up next to two TVs at similar price points and feature levels -- the TCL 6-Series and Sony X90J -- and while it has its high points, I liked it the least of the three. The Hisense delivered the brightest image and with bright HDR material it looked impactful and vibrant. On the other hand its theatrical HDR image lagged behind, with brighter letterbox bars and more blooming. It also showed more blurring in games than the other two. Dim lighting: The Hisense was a very solid performer in home theater lighting with standard dynamic range video. Watching the dark Dol Guldur section of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies on 1080p Blu-ray (Chapter 3) the Hisense, TCL and Sony all looked very similar after calibration for a dim room. Black level in areas like the letterbox bars and shadows of Gandalf's cage, for example, was excellent, and details in near-black areas like the stairs and ledges of the fortress appeared natural and well-defined. No TV in my lineup enjoyed a significant advantage over another in this category. Bright lighting: The U8G's prodigious brightness serves it well in bright rooms. The only TVs I've reviewed with higher light output are the Samsung QN90A and the Vizio PX, both of which cost more.I also appreciate that the Hisense's brightest picture modes are quite accurate. For the ""accurate"" column I used the Theater Bright mode for SDR and Theater HDR for, um, HDR, and both are as color-accurate as this TV gets. Technically Vivid was slightly brighter for SDR, but not enough to matter. The screen of the Hisense didn't dim reflections as well as the Sony X90J or TCL 6-Series, but it preserved black levels slightly better than the TCL. Color accuracy: The Hisense didn't have any color issues. Before calibration it measured exceedingly accurate in its best modes, Theater and Filmmaker, and with just a few tweaks it became even better.Comparing colors from Five Armies the three TVs looked very similar, from the reddish tinge of the ruined Dale buildings to the white of the snow to the skin tones of the Laketown refugees. Video processing: The U8G was an average performer in this category. In its favor it delivered correct 24-frame film motion when its Motion Enhancement setting was in the Off or the Film position -- the latter is the default for the Filmmaker picture mode. The other settings introduced some level of smoothing or Soap Opera Effect. Meanwhile the Custom setting's Judder Reduction introduced SOE at level 4 or higher out of 10, while 0 through 3 showed some judder. Unlike most TVs of this caliber, the Hisense isn't capable of delivering higher than 600 lines of motion resolution in my test, regardless of mode. The Motion Clearness option also doesn't seem to improve motion resolution much; I still measured a maximum of 600 lines with it turned on as well. It does fix the backlight at a particular level however, so I left it turned off. Uniformity: Each of the three screens was roughly similar at delivering an even image across the screen, with no major bright or dark spots, banding or other major issues with most material. The Hisense did show more blooming and stray illumination than the others, however, which showed up most prominently in the corners. From off-angle the Hisense was slightly better at maintaining color fidelity than the TCL and about the same as the Sony, while the Hisense's black level fidelity from off-angle was similar to the others. Gaming: Connecting my Xbox One Series X the Hisense supported 4K at 120Hz with VRR, and automatically engaged game mode. But when I started a game, Mass Effect 3 from the Legendary Edition, I noticed some blurring or ghosting along the edges of objects when I moved the camera, in particular high-contrast dark areas like a character's black hair against a brighter surround. Hisense has issued a software update that it said would address the issue, but even running that update (version V000.01.00A.L0706) the blurring persisted. It was present in 60Hz and 1080p as well. I also played a bit of Assassin's Creed: Valhalla and it didn't seem as obvious, but still visible. I wouldn't call it a deal-breaker -- many TVs show blurring during gaming, especially quick right-stick camera moves -- but it is something attentive gamers will likely notice and be bothered by. In comparison the TCL, for example, didn't show nearly as much ghosting. For what it's worth other aspects of gaming image quality on the Hisense, especially contrast and brightness, were very good. Input lag in game mode was excellent at just over 15 milliseconds for both 1080p and 4K HDR. That's just a couple milliseconds more (worse) than least-laggy 2021 TVs from LG and Samsung, and four or so better than the TCL, if you're counting, but I doubt even the twitchiest of gamers would notice those differences. HDR and 4K video: The U8G's insane brightness came through most readily with HDR, but unfortunately for Hisense brightness isn't everything. This TV showed a less natural look than the TCL and Sony, particularly with mixed theatrical material, and more blooming than either one. In its favor, however, it blew both out of the water with bright HDR. That superiority was immediately evident when I popped in my go-to evaluation sequence for HDR, the montage from the Spears and Munsil 4K Blu-ray. Spot measurements, for example the setting sun above the lake (2:10) measured 391, 560 and 621 nits on the Sony, TCL and Hisense respectively, a difference that was easily visible. Another obvious difference came with the objects on largely black backgrounds, such as the peacock feather (2:59). The Hisense's ""black"" was visibly deeper than the Sony's and just a hair brighter (worse) than the TCLs, but in terms of impact and overall impression of contrast and pop, the Hisense was the best of the three with this material. Its colors also looked more saturated and natural than the TCL, and equal to the Sony. The Hisense didn't look quite as good as the other two with mixed theatrical content, however. Watching dark and mid-dark scenes in The Battle of the Five Armies, the Hisense looked worse than the other two. In Chapter 9 when the Council rescues Gandalf from Dol Guldur, the U8G's letterbox bars were brighter, robbing the image of pop, and the tower as a whole (28:04) looked flatter and less contrasty. I saw the same slight flatness difference in other dark scenes, for example when Thorin speaks before the backdrop of Dale (40:19), and it could be caused by the U8G's less-accurate EOTF. Blooming in the letterbox bars and dark shadows was also more obvious and distracting on the Hisense than the others, especially in the lower-right and upper-left corners of my review sample.  In its favor the Hisense showed excellent color again, a step ahead of the TCL and equal to the Sony, but overall with theatrical material it was my least-favorite. CNET is no longer publishing advanced picture settings for TVs we review. Instead, we'll give more general recommendations to get the best picture without listing detailed while balance or color management system (CMS) settings we may have used to calibrate the TV. As always, the settings provided are a guidepost, and if you want the most accurate picture you should get a professional calibration. Prior to calibration, the Theater Night, Theater Day and Filmmaker modes were the most accurate on the U8G. All three modes showed somewhat reddish color temperature and higher brightness than my dim-room target. After adjusting brightness to hit my 137-nit target, the basic two-point color temperature controls worked superbly to calibrate the red cast away, to the extent that I didn't need to touch the available 10-point system at all. Primary and secondary color accuracy was a similar story: accurate enough that I didn't need to use the CMS. HDR Notes: I ended up using HDR Theater mode because it had the best combination of brightness and grayscale accuracy, but it wasn't very accurate. Unfortunately none of the modes, including HDR Theater, closely followed the target EOTF. Four delivered roughly the most accurate grayscale, namely HDR Game, IMAX Mode, HDR Theater and Filmmaker. The first three were brighter than the target EOTF, while the latter was darker (and exceedingly dark overall). I ended up going with HDR Theater for my testing because unlike IMAX mode it allowed me to tweak settings; IMAX was grayed out. The less-accurate EOTF also affected secondary color measurements, ColorMatch HDR and Color Checker. Gamut coverage was excellent, however."
43,9,wired,8,https://www.wired.com/review/hisense-u8g/,This moderately priced Android TV looks great and has every app you will ever need.,"FOR YEARS, I told people to buy the best-looking screen for the money, and then get a streaming device to go with it. The onboard ecosystems on most TVs were so bad that it didn't make sense to even take them into account. Flash forward to today: Now you might actually pick your TV based on its interface. Roku is built into many of our favorite TCL models, Vizio’s Smartcast system makes sharing tabs easier than elsewhere, and Android TV is pretty darn great in Hisense models. These screens all look so good, and have such similar specs, that you might as well get the one that uses your favorite streaming OS. If the TCL 6 Series and new Vizio M-Series are the price-to-performance kings of Roku and Smartcast, the new Hisense U8G is the best TV for fans of Google. The U8G has excellent local dimming, great gaming performance, and a cool-looking center stand. Anyone who loves Android will probably love this Android TV. The U8G has a nondescript modern design, save for a butterfly-shaped pair of legs that supports the center of the TV. Unlike the spindly sticks that jut out from the bottom of most modern screens, these thoughtful, elegant legs make you want to use them, rather than mount the TV to the wall. I also love how they raise the TV pretty high off my stand. A few of the larger soundbars don’t completely fit under TVs. Even if you don't care about losing a small sliver of screen forever, it often causes problems with the remote. The U8G’s legs clear every one of my soundbars, including the big Dolby Atmos bars. Setup is as simple as you’d expect from any modern TV. There’s a two-prong power cord, two HDMI 2.1 ports capable of 120 Hz at 4K with a variable refresh rate (and two other HDMI ports good for 60 Hz), plus all the other bog-standard TV inputs you’ll need. It even comes with an adapter for plugging in classic red/white/yellow cables, like from my old N64. I love it. The TV immediately asked me to use my Google account for setup. Because I use an Android phone daily, I barely had to look for extra apps that I use. All my logins were either stored or exceptionally easy to input. Speaking of apps, I was happy to find every major option I needed—including the oft-neglected HBO Max!—on Android TV. Built-in Chromecast makes streaming things from a desktop easy if you use the Chrome browser, and I like that you can turn Google’s voice assistant on or off. The remote has quick buttons to take you to Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, YouTube, Tubi TV, and Peacock. The remote also has backlighting and Bluetooth connectivity. You do have to pair it with the TV on initial setup. A $1,000 price tag for the 55-inch model means the U8G looks and feels like more of a premium option than our favorite affordable TCLs and Vizios. Instead, its direct competitors are upgrades like the Samsung QN90A. In this league, it performs pretty well. Solid local dimming helps with black levels, and it has fairly bright highlights in HDR via HDR10+ and Dolby Vision support. AMD Freesync made it a great TV to use with my computer’s Radeon graphics card when playing Formula 1 2021. High refresh rates really make racing games look amazing. It works nearly as well as a computer monitor as it does as a TV, a trend I’m happy to see descending from higher-end TVs this year. I didn’t use the TV in a particularly bright room (my review room lacks windows), but those who have brighter spaces might like that it has a new anti-reflective film that is supposed to limit glare. One thing I did notice and love was Filmmaker Mode, which removes post processing but maintains color and frame rates when watching movies. It’s particularly great when watching older films like Cool Hand Luke, which appear color graded to perfection out of the box. There's also a Game Mode, which supports the highest frame rates from PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and a Sports Mode, which smooths out motion when watching fast-paced events—great for the Olympics and watching my beloved Portland Timbers. As with most modern TVs, you want a soundbar. The U8G sounds pretty bad on its own. If you’re spending $1,000 on a TV, get something a bit nice to listen to it with. In terms of interface, it crushes the competition from both LG and Samsung. Android TV has come a long way since it had terrible apps and felt super clunky. These days, it’s very nearly as good as Roku, with a better voice assistant. The interface doesn’t have ads, and it pulls shows from all the paid services that Covid boredom made me subscribe to. The main screen is usable in a way that most other interfaces simply aren’t. Even changing between inputs feels easier, thanks to all those buttons for services that people actually use (save Tubi and Peacock). When you combine this ease of use with the excellent screen, great processing, and 120-Hz refresh rate when gaming in 4K, it’s really hard to find anything not to like about the U8G, except its price. You can get a cheaper TCL or Vizio model that looks very nearly as good and does very nearly everything this well, but this model does look and feel a bit nicer than those. It has a solid price-to-performance ratio, especially when compared to spendier models from Sony and Samsung. If you are after a TV that works for gaming, sports, and watching films at home, and you like Google’s not-so-walled garden, the U8G is well worth a peek."
44,9,Techradar,4,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hisense-u8g-android-tv-65u8g,"Regardless of whether you consider yourself a hardcore gamer, cinephile or an individual simply looking for a value-packed 4K TV, the Hisense U8G provides a lot of something for everyone.","Hisense has spent the past couple of years making outstanding TVs like the Hisense U80G ULED 8K TV that undercut the big dogs like Samsung, Sony and LG without many compromises. That continues with the new Hisense U8G ULED which the Chinese electronics manufacturer aptly describes as “Great For Everything.” It's a fitting description for the ULED 4K Android TV that’s sure to please everyone from gamers with next-generation consoles to movie lovers and anyone else in-between. Besides offering a full suite of Dolby features including Vision, IQ and Atmos, the U8G also packs in HDR10+ and native 120Hz panel. All of this is controlled through the Android TV operating system that incorporates both Google Assistant, built-in Chromecast and voice controls with privacy switch. All that said, if you're looking to purchase a well rounded UHD television that’s feature-packed without spending an arm and a leg you should definitely keep the U8G in mind. The Hisense U8G comes in two screen sizes - 55 inches and 65 inches - both are available now at major retailers including Amazon and Best Buy. Expect to pay $999 for the 55-inch and $1,249 for those extra ten inches of visual real estate. Compared to other UHD TVs with similar sizes, the LG Nano 90 costs a bit more with the 55-inch and 65-inch being priced at $1,049 and $1,499. Meanwhile, the Sony X900H is priced similarly to the U8G at $999 for the 55-inch with the 65-inch costing $1,399. Of the three, we think the Sony is a bit of a better value for the money - especially if you're looking for the best 55-inch TV, but at 65-inches the Hisense U8G is very competitive at its price point. Many have praised Hisense's recent displays for their modern design philosophy, and that will likely continue with the U8G: the legs that extend out fairly far out to the sides and despite keeping the TV incredibly sturdy, this is definitely meant to be the centerpiece. Buyers who sit their televisions on top of furniture like dressers may have to put their space management skills to the test. That shouldn't be a problem if you have a wide entertainment center but, if not, it's worth noting that the stands are spread out beyond the back of the TV and you'll have to be a bit careful if you’re used to placing devices behind your display. The good news is that the bezels on the U8G are fairly thin all around and make the TV look fairly thin regardless of viewing angle. At the bottom, the bezel gets a bit thick as that’s where the microphone alongside the mic off/on switch is located. Behind the display, the TV doesn’t protrude out much and lifting it isn’t too bad considering the U8G weighs under 60 pounds. Moving the TV out of the box to a table wasn’t difficult after screwing in the legs. Ports are adequate as well. Mainly configured on the left side behind the display, the power cord lays on the opposite side. Four HDMI ports including one eARC, two USB inputs, RF input, RCA composite input and 3.5mm audio sit vertically. Nearby horizontally are ports for digital audio output and LAN. Gamers who are lucky enough to get their hands on both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S will be happy to know that two of the HDMI ports support 4K at 120Hz while the other two support 4K at 60Hz. This leaves enough room for two next-gen consoles, Nintendo Switch and a selected streaming device for good measure. The packaged remote control for the U8G doesn’t reach the simplicity of remotes from Roku or Apple TV but it does the job in terms of navigation. There’s also a Google Assistant button as well alongside Android TV software controls. Like many modern remotes, there’s also quick buttons that’ll take users to apps like Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, YouTube, Tubi and Peacock. The IR remote does have Bluetooth built-in but it has to be mainly connected through the menu button which seems a bit odd. When the lights are off, however, navigation isn’t difficult due to a backlight. Admittedly, there's nothing special about the remote but it definitely gets the job done. There have been many complaints about modern TVs that utilize Android TV in regards to responsiveness. For the U8G, there wasn’t much sluggishness or non-responsive moments during testing. Apps including Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+ and more booted adequately without any issue. If you are already a loyal member of the Android ecosystem, setting up the U8G is a breeze. Once logged in through your Gmail account, everything from Wi-Fi to apps are logged in automatically which relieves users of the “new TV” annoyance of re-entering logins and passwords on certain apps. If you're already using Netflix or Disney+ on your phone, Google will use its password-bank automatically following a prompt. There are also voiceless controls as well due to the U8G’s built-in microphone when not asking to do anything too complex. That's largely a great feature, but if you have multiple smart TVs, Android devices and/or Google Homes, there’s the possibility of erratic moments where Google gets a bit confused. During moments of media controls, voice controls work well for basic playback actions like Stop, Pause, Rewind, Fast Forward and Play. One of the biggest positives for Android TV is the sheer number of apps spread out between streaming services and games. Of course, users who want to play the large amount of games available on Google Play like Asphalt Racing, Unkilled, Crossy Road and the likes are going to need a compatible gamepad. More so if users want to try their hand at Google Stadia. Hisense’s ULED technology continues to improve and the U8G is further proof: rich, beautiful colors and deep blacks make shows, films and games look jaw dropping. Besides offering 4K resolution, the U8G’s native 120Hz screen supports IMAX Enhanced, FilmMaker Mode, Dolby Vision, Dolby IQ, HDR10+/HDR10 and Quantum Dots. Dimming zones have been increased from 180 to 360 alongside a dynamic contrast ratio of 10,000:1 and up to 1,500 nits peak brightness. This means that regardless of viewing angle or brightness of the room one is viewing in, picture quality remains phenomenal. Built into the U8G is a special anti-glare film as well. As mentioned previously, the U8G is probably the most well-rounded television from Hisense feature-wise, but the excellent picture quality is the main draw. There are a slew of various picture setting options from brightness to picture modes. Sports lovers with a keen eye for visuals may find some usage out of the various motion enhancement and clearness modes. It’s definitely noticeable during testing as the biggest sports event in the world, the 2021 Olympics, looked gorgeous. Another great sports example is Netflix’s Naomi Osaka documentary which takes advantage of Dolby Vision and HDR10. Cinephiles may appreciate FilmMaker Mode which disables post-processing while preserving correct aspect ratios, colors and frame rates as intended by the filmmaker. It definitely looks great when looking at older monochrome film or anything before digital cameras took over. This means that classics like A Fistfull of Dollars, Bullitt or even Blaxploitation films like TNT Jackson look amazing. Though not as gaming-focused as Hisense’s U7G, there’s much for gamers to appreciate with the U8G. Alongside offering 4K with a 120Hz refresh rate, the TV also features a Game Mode Pro which has VRR and FreeSync Premium for improved input lag. Though next-generation consoles from both Sony and Microsoft have yet to truly utilize the full potential power, there are some games that look phenomenal on the U8G. PS5 games like Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart support 4K/120Hz and it’ll be difficult to go back to 60Hz  once players get a chance to check it out. There are more games on Xbox Series X|S like Mass Effect Legendary Edition that really feels as if it enhances gameplay. For better or worse, audio quality is consistent alongside Hisense’s newer crop of TVs. If users are looking for a louder cinematic experience, a soundbar or speaker system may be the best option. On its own, the U8G built-in speakers offer an average audio experience. Though the TV can get incredibly loud, audio quality does diminish once users go beyond the 20 point range. Below that volume level in a small to medium room, sound quality is fairly rich when watching a television series or watching a film. When listening to music on high fidelity music streaming services like Tidal, sound quality is great... if you within a reasonable volume range. There’s some richness in treble and mid-tones while bass sounds nicely deep. Just remember that at higher levels, there’s a level of distortion that some may find uncomfortable. You need some phenomenal image quality Whether watching TV shows, films and playing the latest next-generation consoles from Microsoft or Sony, the U8G looks flat out stunning in use. Helps that it supports HDR and Dolby Vision. You are already invested in Google’s Android Ecosystem If you’re an Android user, everything from initial TV set up to logging into various streaming services is a breeze. Unlike previous Hisense models, the UI isn’t sluggish either. You want a nice feature-set for a nearly budget price $999 for the 55-inch and $1,299 for the 65-inch, the Hisense U8G is perfect for those who want a little bit more than a budget 4K but can’t afford more premium TVs. You require premium built-in audio At lower levels, the audio experience on the U8G works totally fine for shows, films and music streaming. Things are a different story in the higher range, though. You want better voice controls Voice controls work for simple tasks like media controls but trying to switch between apps can become a pain. The ability to turn off voice controls through a mic switch on the television is a nice touch. You don’t have room for the large stand placement The stands themselves keep the UG8 sturdy and in place. However, they’re pretty wide and intrusive space wise."
45,9,pcmag,4.5,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hisense-65u8g,"The Hisense U8G series is a bit more expensive than its predecessor, but it delivers more features and better picture quality than you'll get from any other TV in this price range.","The Hisense H9G was one of our favorite TVs of 2020, combining an excellent picture with a stylish design and hands-free Google Assistant for a very reasonable price. The company is following up this line with the U8G series, which is even brighter than the H9G and adds a number of gamer-friendly features to the mix. It’s also a fair bit more expensive, crossing the $1,000 mark with the 65-inch 65U8G model we tested retailing for $1,299.99. That’s still a very reasonable price for the features and performance you get, making the Hisense H9G our Editors’ Choice winner for midrange TVs. The U8G has a gorgeous design, with an edge-to-edge glass panel framed by a silver band that rests just behind it, keeping the screen itself front and center. The bottom edge holds a narrow silver bezel with a small sensor array protruding down from the middle. The entire TV sits on two triangular gray metal legs that attach to the bottom, just a few inches past a third of the screen’s width from either direction, sitting significantly narrower than the TV itself and giving you more flexibility in where you can place it. You can also mount it on the wall. With the exception of the power connector on the right side, all of the U8G’s ports sit on the left side of the back of the panel. Four HDMI ports, two USB ports (one 0.5A, one 1A), a 3.5mm composite video input, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and an antenna/cable connector face left. An Ethernet port, an optical audio output, and 3.5mm serial and service ports face directly back. The included remote is much less busy than the one that came with the previous model, omitting the seldom-used number pad and color buttons entirely. It’s a black rectagular wand covered in rubber buttons, with a prominent circular navigation pad. Power, Input, and Google Assistant buttons sit above the pad, along with a combination pinhole microphone and status light. Menu buttons and volume/channel rockers sit below the pad, with playback controls and dedicated service buttons for Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Netflix, Peacock, Tubi, and YouTube below them. Hisense uses Android TV for the U8G’s interface, like the H8G and H9G before it. It’s slightly clunkier than the Google TV interface used by the Sony A90J and the Chromecast With Google TV, but it’s still just as functional and loaded with features. Most major streaming services are available, including Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Twitch, and YouTube. However, while the Apple TV app is available on Google TV, it doesn’t currently work on Android TV, so you can’t run it on the U8G. Google Cast is integrated with Android TV, so you can stream from any Android phone or tablet, or a Chrome tab. Google Assistant is built into Android TV and the U8G features far-field microphones for hands-free voice control. Just say, “Hey Google,” followed by a request, and the TV will respond accordingly. Google Assistant can search for content, provide general information like the weather forecast and sports scores, and control both the TV and a wide range of smart home devices. If you have an Amazon smart speaker, you can also control the TV with Alexa. The Hisense U8G is a 4K TV that supports high dynamic range (HDR) content in Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and hybrid log gamma (HLG). It has a 120Hz refresh rate and supports automatic low latency mode (ALLM), variable refresh rate (VRR), and AMD FreeSync. We test TVs with a Klein K-10A colorimeter, a Murideo SIX-G signal generator, and Portrait Displays’ Calman software using methodology based on Imaging Science Foundation’s calibration techniques. In the Theater Day picture mode with default backlight settings and an SDR signal, the U8G showed a peak brightness of 581.856cd/m^2 for a full-screen white field, 858.031cd/m^2 for an 18% screen white field, and a black level of 0.34cd/m^2 for a contrast ratio of 25,236:1. Pushing the backlight to maximum bumped those numbers up to 707.693cd/m^2 for a full-screen field, 1,037.702cd/m^2 for an 18% field, and a black level of 0.41cd/m^2, for a nearly identical contrast ratio. Those are impressive results, and that’s only with an SDR signal—with an HDR10 signal, the brightness and contrast get even better. In Theater Day mode with the default backlight, an HDR10 signal produced a peak brightness of 780.201cd/m^2 for a full-screen white field, 1,763.368cd/m^2 for an 18% screen field, and a black level of 0.02cd/m^2 (and pumping up the backlight to maximum didn’t change those numbers significantly). That’s a contrast ratio of 88.168:1, which is excellent for any TV. Because the H9G’s black level is slightly lower (0.01cd/m^2), its contrast ratio is higher (124,383:1), but the U8G gets markedly brighter with both SDR and HDR signals. Color performance is downright fantastic. The above chart shows color measurements using an SDR signal compared with Rec.709 broadcast standard color values, and using an HDR10 signal compared with DCI-P3 digital cinema color values, both using the Theater Day picture mode. In both cases, the U8G covers the respective color spaces with impressive accuracy out of the box. Only one color deviated significantly from its ideal levels, with magenta leaning quite red with an HDR10 signal, but all primary colors hit their marks nearly perfectly. BBC’s Planet Earth II looks excellent on the U8G. Bright subjects stand out as very bright, and shadows appear dark while still showing detail. Colors are vibrant and saturated, looking vivid but natural. The blues of water and greens of leaves all look full and colorful. Fine textures like fur and bark are easy to see in all lighting conditions. The red of Deadpool’s costume in Deadpool looks vivid in the opening scene, without a hint of blueish tinting under the overcast lighting. The burning lab fight later in the film shows very bright flames and strong shadow detail, thanks to the TV’s contrast. The party scenes in The Great Gatsby also look impressive on the U8G. White shirts and lights stand out, while the cuts of dark suits the and textures of dark hair are still visible without appearing washed out. Throughout the many high-contrast scenes in the film, skin tones look natural and nicely saturated. The U8G is packed with gamer-friendly features, including the aforementioned ALLM, VRR, and AMD FreeSync. Just as importantly, the TV’s input lag, the amount of time between when it receives a signal and the screen updates, keeps apace with those features. We test input lag using an HDFury Diva HDMI matrix, and with a 60Hz signal the U8G showed a lag of 7.9 milliseconds in the Game picture mode, well under the 20ms threshold we use to determine the best TVs for gaming. Be aware that using another picture mode, like Theater Day, bumps that number up to 102.6ms, so make sure you’re in Game mode before you start playing. The Hisense U8G is a fantastic TV for a reasonable price. It’s more expensive than the previous H9G line, but even crossing the $1,000 mark for the 65-inch model we reviewed, you’ll have a hard time finding a similarly priced TV that looks nearly as good. And even if you splurge on an OLED model like the Sony Master Series A90J, it won’t be nearly as bright as this one, earning the U8G our Editors' Choice award. If you’re looking for a 65-inch TV under $1,000, or a 55-inch TV for far less, the TCL 6-Series remains one of our your best bets, as does the Hisense H8G. Just be aware that you’ll be compromising on brightness and contrast, and losing hands-free Google Assistant (and in the case of the TCL model, any voice assistant at all)."
46,10,RTINGS,8.6,https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/qn90a-qled,The Samsung QN90A is an excellent TV for any use.,"The Samsung QN90A QLED is a flagship 4k LED TV. It's part of Samsung's 2021 Neo QLED lineup, which combines Mini LED backlighting with a quantum dot layer to display a wide range of colors at various luminance levels. The Mini LED backlighting helps the TV display deeper blacks as it has greater control over its local dimming feature, and it also gets very bright, enough to combat glare or bring out highlights. It comes with the Tizen smart platform, which is easy-to-use and has a ton of apps available to download, and the new remote has a solar panel in the back, so it uses sunlight to charge. It comes with a bunch of gaming features like variable refresh rate (VRR) support and HDMI 2.1 bandwidth, but only on one port, which is disappointing as you can't take full advantage of two next-gen gaming consoles at the same time. The Samsung QN90A is an excellent TV for any use. It's excellent for movies in dark rooms as its VA panel provides an excellent native contrast ratio and has a great local dimming to display deep blacks. It gets bright enough to combat glare and has fantastic reflection handling if you want to use it in a well-lit room while watching shows and sports. It also displays a wide range of colors for an excellent HDR experience. Also, it's amazing for gaming because it has variable refresh rate (VRR) support, low input lag, and quick response time for smooth motion handling. The Samsung QN90A is excellent for watching movies in a dark room. It has a VA panel with excellent native contrast and great Mini LED local dimming to display deep blacks. It also upscales lower-resolution content well, like from Blu-rays, and automatically removes 24p judder from any source. The Samsung QN90A is excellent for watching TV shows in a bright room. It easily gets bright enough to combat glare in well-lit rooms and has fantastic reflection handling, meaning visibility won't be an issue. It has a wide viewing angle, so the image remains accurate when viewing from the side, which is great for watching shows with the entire family. Lastly, it upscales lower-resolution content like cable TV without any issues. The Samsung QN90A is excellent for watching sports. Fast-moving content looks smooth thanks to its very quick response time, and it has a backlight strobing feature to help reduce motion blur. It's great for viewing in bright rooms thanks to its fantastic reflection handling and very high peak brightness. It has a decent viewing angle if you want to watch the big game with a few friends. The Samsung QN90A is amazing for gaming. It's packed with gaming features like HDMI 2.1 bandwidth and VRR support. Its 120Hz panel has a very quick response time, resulting in smooth motion, and the input lag is very low. It's great for dark room gaming thanks to its excellent native contrast ratio, but the local dimming feature performs worse in Game Mode than outside of it. Sadly, it only has one HDMI port that supports HDMI 2.1, so you can't take full advantage of both the PS5 and Xbox Series X if you connect them at the same time. The Samsung QN90A is excellent for watching HDR movies. It displays a wide color gamut, and it supports HDR10+, but not Dolby Vision, so you can't take advantage of the Dolby Vision format in some streaming content. It gets bright enough to make highlights pop, has an excellent native contrast ratio, and its Mini LED local dimming feature helps it display deep blacks. It also has fantastic black uniformity, but there's still some blooming around bright objects. The Samsung QN90A is amazing for HDR gaming. It's excellent for gaming, thanks to its very quick response time and low input lag. It has native FreeSync support and G-SYNC compatibility to reduce screen tearing. In terms of HDR, it displays a wide color gamut and has incredible HDR brightness in Game Mode. It also has an excellent native contrast ratio to provide a great dark room gaming experience, but its local dimming feature isn't as good in Game Mode. The Samsung QN90A is an excellent choice to use as a PC monitor. It has a very low input lag and quick response time to provide a responsive gaming experience. Thanks to its wide viewing angle, the image remains mostly accurate at the edges if you sit too close. You also won't have any issues in a well-lit room either, as it gets bright enough to combat glare and has fantastic reflection handling. Lastly, it displays proper chroma 4:4:4 with most signals, which helps it display clear text.

47,10,CNET,8.2,https://www.cnet.com/reviews/samsung-qn75qn90a-review/,"With superior brightness and precise local dimming, this high-end TV gives LG's OLED a run for its money.","OLED TVs still have the best picture quality I've ever tested, but Samsung's QN90A comes closer than ever. This QLED TV packs a punch brighter than any OLED television, while managing to maintain contrast and black level to a degree I've never seen on any non-OLED before. If you crave that brightness, or you watch in a bright room where ambient light is a big issue, you should definitely consider this TV over a comparable OLED. New for 2021, the best Samsung QLED models like the QN90A are called Neo QLED and feature a new mini-LED based, full-array local dimming backlight array. Samsung made its LEDs 40 times smaller than conventional LED units, allowing more to be packed into the TV, and added a ""quantum matrix"" to help direct the LED light more accurately. The result is improved HDR highlights with minimal blooming (stray illumination that bleeds from bright into dark areas), as well as better shadow detail. All of those improvements were visible in my side-by-side tests. I pitted the QN90A against the best OLED TV I've ever reviewed, the LG G1, and the brightest TV I've ever measured, the Vizio PQX-H1. Overall I liked the LG a bit better than the Samsung -- it's plenty-bright itself, and its perfect black levels, superior mixed-scene contrast and better off-angle viewing won by a nose -- but the QN90A looked better in some scenes, particularly bright HDR. Meanwhile its precise light control and resulting contrast soundly beat the Vizio. In sum, this is the best LCD-based TV I've ever tested and an excellent high-end alternative to OLED. One TV looks much like another, but Samsung still succeeds in giving the QN90A a luxurious air. The most obvious design upgrade is the stand: centered, with a small footprint, it looks cleaner and sleeker than the dual legs found on most TVs. My favorite aspect is how it suspends the big panel above my credenza, seeming to float without touching. As expected the edge around the picture is super-thin, albeit not quite as minimalist as the ""Infinity Screen"" found on the flagship, 8K resolution Q900A. From the side you can appreciate its swoopy, one-piece shape, as well as the fact that it cants the whole screen back by a couple of degrees. The backside has a cable management system that lets you channel power and HDMI from their ports, along the back and through the stand, making for a cleaner look. And yes, the remote has a solar panel on the back. I didn't test Samsung's claim that leaving it under indoor lighting is sufficient to recharge, but I appreciated that it doesn't need batteries. If I owned this TV I'd probably use the USB charging port instead when it ran out of juice. Samsung's remote is one of my favorites to use, with minimal buttons and just the right feel in-hand. Channel and volume keys click up and down, Ambient mode gets its own button as does the mic for voice and even the Netflix and Amazon app shortcut keys are nicer than on other remotes: They lack garish colors and instead just match the rest of the wand. Ambient mode is designed to show stuff on the screen when you're not watching TV. It's a cool feature if you don't like the big black rectangle of an inert TV and can display your photos, designer art, the weather, headlines and even adjust backgrounds to match your wall. Voice command is built-in and you can choose between Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or Samsung's homebrew Bixby. Whichever one you choose will be available when you press the mic button on the clicker. With Amazon and Bixby (but not Google) you also have the option of simply saying ""Alexa"" or ""Hi, Bixby"" wake words, allowing you to issue commands hands-free and unlike last year the mic is located in the TV itself, not the remote. And like most TVs, you can also pair the QN90A with separate Alexa or Google speakers. Samsung's health app debuted on its TVs in 2020 and this year it's expanding to offer guided personal training. Plug in an optional webcam (Samsung has a list of recommended cameras, all by Logitech) and the app will track your exercises and give you coaching complete with celebrity personal trainers like Jillian Michaels. You can also use that webcam for video chat with the Google Duo app, which allows up to 12 others to join the chat. And if you don't have a camera plugged in you can screen mirror Duo on your phone to the TV and use its camera. It's not Google's more popular Meet software, but at least it's web chat on the big screen. I didn't test the webcam features for this review, but I did test drive the personal trainer earlier this year -- and worked up a sweat, as seen in the video below. Beyond voice and the webcam, Samsung's on-screen smart TV system is excellent, with quick responses and plenty of apps -- I'd take it over LG or Vizio's systems. I still like Roku and Android/Google TV (found on Sony TVs) better overall, however, because they have even more apps. Just like most TVs now (including Roku), Samsung has the Apple TV app and works with Apple's AirPlay system. Samsung sells a few higher-end TVs, including 8K resolution models as well as super-expensive Micro-LED TVs, but the Q90A is still bursting with image quality extras. The most important is that Neo QLED, mini-LED powered backlight with full-array local dimming. Local dimming improves LCD image quality by making certain areas of the picture dimmer or brighter in reaction to what's on the screen, which significantly boosts contrast. Judging from Samsung's obscure ""quantum HDR"" spec the QN90A has more dimming zones and brighter images than the step-down Q85A, and fewer zones than the 8K models, but Samsung doesn't say exactly how many zones (or how bright). Like all of Samsung QLED TVs, as well as most higher-end TVs from Vizio and TCL, the QN90A's LCD panel is augmented by a layer of quantum dots -- microscopic nanocrystals that glow a specific wavelength (i.e. color) when given energy. The effect is better brightness and color compared to non-QD-equipped TVs. The QN90A uses a true 120Hz panel, which improves the TVs' motion performance. The set supports high dynamic range content in the HDR10 and the HDR10 Plus formats. It lacks the Dolby Vision HDR support found on most competitors' HDR TVs. I've seen no evidence that one HDR format is inherently ""better"" than the other, so I definitely don't consider the lack of Dolby Vision a deal-breaker on this TV -- it performs like a champ without that format. Gaming features are one of the QN90A's strong points. All four of its HDMI inputs are compatible with variable refresh rate, including AMD's FreeSync and standard VRR formats, as well as ALLM (aka Auto Game Mode), which lets it automatically switch to game mode to reduce input lag when it detects you're playing a game. Only Input 3 handles eARC. Input 4, which is conveniently marked with a little game controller icon, also accepts 4K/120Hz with and without HDR. None of the other inputs handle 4K/120, which should only be a problem if you have multiple devices that output it -- like a PlayStation 5 and an Xbox Series X (you know who you are...), or one of those consoles and a high-end graphics card. It's worth noting that every input on LG's recent OLED TVs supports 4K/120. The list is mostly solid, unless you happen to own a legacy device that requires analog video (component or composite) or audio. Like many new high-end TVs the QN90A lacks analog inputs entirely, audio or video. On the flipside, it is one of the few TVs with a built-in ATSC 3.0 tuner for Next-Gen TV signals. The Samsung QN90A has the best picture of any non-OLED TV I've tested and the best bright-room picture full stop. It's exceedingly bright, yet able to deliver deep, inky black levels with minimal blooming even with the most challenging HDR material. It can't beat the contrast and theatricality of competing high-end OLED models like the LG G1 overall, however, and also falls a bit short in uniformity and off-angle performance. If I had to choose one TV to watch every day it would still be an OLED, but it's very close. Dim lighting: Watching the basic, SDR 1080p version of The Desolation of Smaug Blu-ray in a dark room, the Samsung QN90A came as close to the LG OLED as I've ever seen from an LCD-based TV. Its black levels were essentially perfect -- or close enough that I couldn't visually distinguish them from the OLED -- in most scenes, even in the letterbox bars and shadows. When Gandalf meets Thorin during the prologue at the Prancing Pony, for example, it was really difficult to tell the two apart, while the black levels on the Vizio, in comparison, were lighter and created a flatter, less three-dimensional look. In rare cases, for example the titles against a black screen, the Samsung's black levels did look lighter (worse) than the LG's. Details in shadows were excellent on all three TVs, although again the Vizio looked a bit less realistic because of its slightly lighter overall black levels. Watching SDR I didn't see any evidence of blooming or stray illumination on either the Samsung or the Vizio with normal video. The exceptions were graphical elements, for example the play/pause icons my Blu-ray player put in the upper left created a faint halo against the letterbox bar on the Samsung. Bright lighting: The QN90A is exceedingly bright, especially compared to OLED models. The Vizio PX measured a bit brighter overall and also maintained peak brightness in its brightest setting better. As usual the Samsung's brightest setting, Dynamic, was woefully inaccurate. For the Accurate measurements in SDR I used the Natural picture mode in combination with the Warm color temperature setting (the default temperature for Natural is quite blue). If you want an even more-accurate bright-room image you can choose Movie or Filmmaker mode and turn the Brightness control up to 50 (the max), which measured 620 nits. In any case I prefer Vizio's approach of a dedicated, accurate bright-room picture mode. The QN90A maintained steady HDR light output over time in Movie and Filmmaker modes, but in Dynamic mode with both HDR and SDR it fluctuated significantly, starting out at around 2500 nits but falling almost immediately to around 500 -- a massive, five-fold decrease. I've seen that behaviour on past Samsung TVs as well and it seems designed to achieve prominence in charts like the one you see above. It's worth noting that the Vizio PX, among other non-Samsung TV's I've tested, maintained their brightest images much more steadily over time, without drastic fluctuations. This issue in Dynamic mode isn't a huge deal for me, however, because I don't recommend using that mode anyway. Samsung's light-rejecting screen is the best in the business, maintaining contrast and punch in bright lighting, and reducing reflections, better than the Vizio and the LG. The screen, combined with the QN90A's prodigious light output, make it the best TV I've ever tested for bright rooms. Color accuracy: All three high-end TVs measured exceedingly well for color both before and especially after calibration, and watching The Hobbit Blu-ray I couldn't really pick a winner. Colors from Galadriel's delicate skin tone to the green and brown of Mirkwood to the gray of Gandalf's cloak looked true. The LG did show a slight advantage in near-black grayscale, where the Samsung tended slightly blue, but the difference was subtle. Video processing: As usual the Samsung aced my tests in this category, delivering true 1080p/24 film cadence with film-based sources and plenty of motion resolution (1,000 lines) with video-based sources. The TV achieved both results with a Picture Clarity setting of Custom with Blur Reduction at 10 and Judder Reduction at 0, so if I had this TV I'd ""set it and forget it"" right there. Note that Filmmaker Mode's default setting is to turn Picture Clarity off, which results in less motion resolution, but you can adjust it to taste. You can also add more smoothing or soap opera effect by increasing Judder Reduction or choosing Auto instead of Custom. Meanwhile the LED Clear Motion option makes motion even sharper with the help of black frame insertion, at the expense of flicker and a dimmer image. Uniformity: The QN90A's screen was worse than the Vizio and LG at maintaining an even light spread everywhere, with some slight variations visible in full-screen test patterns, particularly along the edges and in the upper middle. In moving test patterns the QN90A showed a slightly more noticeable dirty screen effect as a result, but it was still quite mild. From off-angle the Samsung was slightly better at preserving contrast and color than the Vizio, even when the latter's ""enhanced viewing angle"" mode was engaged, but the differences were minor and both, as usual, significantly trailed the off-angle fidelity of the OLED. Gaming: The QN90A is a gaming powerhouse. When I first plugged in my Xbox Series X the TV automatically detected it, switched to its input and implemented Game Mode, complete with a pop-up at the bottom that Samsung calls the Game Bar -- long-pressing play/pause on the remote calls it up at any time. The Bar's left side consists of a status display listing Input Lag, FPS (frames per second), HDR, VRR and sound output, while controls on the right provides a shortcut to game settings as well as aspect ratio and screen position (the latter only active with PC sources, which I didn't test). Samsung continues its tradition of excellent input lag in game mode with a score of just over 10 milliseconds with both 1080p and 4K HDR sources -- the best I've measured. You can choose to engage smoothing, aka Auto Motion Plus, in game mode but doing so raises input lag as high as 26ms, depending on what level you choose. I'd leave it turned off. Comparing Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, the Samsung looked excellent, brighter than the LG (as expected) and the Vizio, which looked duller and more washed out. I still preferred the LG's look overall with this theatrical game, however, because it preserved more contrast especially at night and underground while still allowing me to see into the shadows well enough. Samsung does offer a special shadow detail control called ""Dynamic Black Equalizer"" that lets you expose/wash out shadows even more, but it doesn't have specialized gaming picture modes like LG. Whether you miss them depends on how much you want to tweak the picture -- I personally like having the option. HDR and 4K video: Like all high-end LCDs the QN90A can get brighter than even the brightest OLED TV, but it does a better job of delivering deep black levels and minimal blooming than any non-OLED TV I've tested. I started my HDR comparison with the montage from the Spears and Munsil HDR Benchmark and the Samsung QN90A's brightness advantage over the LG G1 was immediately apparent. The Q90A measures twice as bright as the G1 and in my side-by-side comparison it looked even brighter, especially in areas like the snow-capped mountains, skies and clouds. That's because OLED's brightness falls rapidly as more of the screen is occupied by bright objects, while LCD's brightness varies less by image area. The Samsung also looked brighter and more impactful in highlights such as the middle of a ferris wheel at night, of course, but in larger areas it was more apparent. Meanwhile the LCD-based Vizio, despite its superior measurements, looked dimmer than the Samsung, albeit still a bit brighter than the OLED. Spot measurements confirmed those impressions. The sunset at 2:08, for example, measured 427, 522 and 887 nits on the LG, Vizio and Samsung, respectively. For their part colors were superb on the Samsung, saturated yet accurate in areas like the flowers and insects at 3:27, and the extra brightness lent additional pop. As usual the OLED maintained perfect black levels while the Samsung and Vizio looked very slightly lighter, but in many scenes -- the objects against black backgrounds, for example -- the Samsung was so good that picking out the OLED was difficult. I did see a bit more blooming than with SDR, as expected, but again it was very well-controlled on the Samsung. In the dipper at 2:49, for example, the black background around the honey betrayed a slight glow, as did the pause icon on my Blu-ray player (again) -- but both were less-noticeable than on the Vizio and just a bit worse than the blooming-free OLED. Mixed scenes, for example the nighttime cityscape at 4:26, did show more of an advantage for OLED, which was able to keep the dark areas darker for more pop, but the Samsung still looked excellent. I didn't notice any banding or similar artifacts in the LG or the Samsung, both of which looked very clean, but there was some on the Vizio. It popped up in the sky during the initial fade up from black, for example, where bands of varying brightness appeared where there should be a smooth transition. The Samsung did show minor brightness variations caused by the backlight structure (particularly near the edges), like the blue sky above the satellite dish at 5:29, but they were quite subtle. I also checked out the montage at 4,000 nits and the Samsung lagged behind the LG. There was less detail in bright areas like the snowy pasture and the cliffside, which made the QN90A appear somewhat flatter despite its superior  brightness. It's not a huge disadvantage however since 4,000 nit content is relatively rare. When I switched from Spears and Munsil to The Desolation of Smaug, the tables turned and the LG looked better overall than the Samsung. During the challenging evening Bree scene in the prologue, for example, the LG's shadows appeared just a bit deeper and its highlights, like the lamps and torches, looked slightly brighter, for an overall high-contrast look that the Samsung -- while excellent -- couldn't quite match. Both outclassed the Vizio, however, whose black levels were lighter leading to a more washed-out look. Moving to a brighter scene, inside Beorn's house (9:16), the G1 again looked a tick more realistic and rich compared to the QN90A. As with Spears and Munsil, large-area brightness scenes favored the Samsung. As the orcs pursue the dwarves across a bright field at 7:50, for example, both LCDs (and especially the Samsung) appeared more brilliant and impressive. But as in most theatrical films, scenes in The Hobbit tended toward more mixed and even darker scenes, where the OLED held a slight contrast advantage over the Samsung. CNET is no longer publishing advanced picture settings for any TVs we review. Instead, we'll give more general recommendations to get the best picture without listing the detailed white balance or color management system (CMS) settings we may have used to calibrate the TV. As always, the settings provided are a guidepost and if you want the most accurate picture you should get a professional calibration. Before my calibration for this review, Samsung's Movie and Filmmaker presets were the most accurate, excellent in terms of grayscale and gamma with just a slight reddish cast (but still within my error target of delta 3). Note that Filmmaker Mode because it disables all of the Picture Clarity settings, including motion enhancement (see the review for details) -- although it does engage ambient light sensing by default, which I turned off. For calibration I tweaked the two-point grayscale to remove the red cast, reduced light output to my target of 137 nits and changed gamma to target 2.2, but otherwise I left well enough alone. The grayscale and color were already so accurate on my Samsung-provided review sample that I didn't need to touch the multipoint system or the color management system. HDR Notes: As with SDR, Samsung's Movie and Filmmaker Modes were the most-accurate for HDR sources. Both were significantly more-accurate than Dynamic, the brightest mode, and still quite bright at more than 1500 nits. The QN90A followed the EOTF closely in both modes but was a bit better in Filmmaker, so that's what I'd choose for the most accurate HDR. Its advanced color measurements were superb, with Color Checker and the more stringent ColorMatch HDR both well under a delta error of 3. The LG G1 OLED was worse on both counts. In terms of gamut coverage the QLED lagged the OLED by a couple percentage points, but it was still above my 95% threshold -- and much better than the Q80 from 2020."
48,10,Techradar,4,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-qn90a-neo-qled-tv,"Thinner, brighter and bolder… but it comes with a few caveats","The Samsung QN90A Neo QLED was one of the first screens in 2021 to use the company’s hyped-up Neo QLED panels that sport a higher count of light emitting diodes per square inch than previous generations. The result was a brighter TV than its predecessors and one that can display a deeply satisfying array of colors. Since its release in 2021, we've seen some newer QLED TVs that use Shape Adaptive Light Control that allows the TVs to have better control over blooming and an upgrade to a 14-bit backlight for more luminance points. Those models include in the new Samsung QN95B – the first QN95 model available globally – and Samsung QN900B 8K QLED TV, two of the best TVs of 2022.That doesn't mean the Samsung QN90A is destined for the trash, however. Inside, all Neo QLED TVs sport the higher-end Neo Quantum Processor 4K that uses a neural network to analyze images for better HD upscaling and Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ for better motion handling – all of which still helps to make the QN90A one of the better options for prospective QLED TV owners. Last but not least, there’s the new GameView and Game Bar features. Game Bar shows you all the key specs gamers care about like the current frames per second (FPS) rate and what version of VRR is currently enabled. GameView allows you to transform the screen ratio from 16:9 to 21:9 or even the outlandishly wide 32:9 ratio if you want an ultra-wide monitor experience from your 65-inch TV. It’s honestly a fun idea and can help offset the cost if you use the TV as both your monitor and your living room entertainment screen. That said, there are a few looming issues this year that we can’t ignore, like the slight wobble of the pedestal stand, or the surprisingly lackluster sound quality that doesn’t befit a flagship 4K TV. There’s also no support for Dolby Vision still, which means you’re stuck with HDR10 on Netflix (albeit with HDR10+ elsewhere). If you're after a solid QLED TV and you see this one on sale for a pittance as Samsung makes way for the new 2022 TV models, it's still a solid pick. The Samsung QN90A Neo QLED TV is part of the Samsung 2021 TV lineup that also includes the Samsung QN85A, Samsung QN80A, Samsung Q70A and Samsung Q60A 4K QLED TVs as well the Samsung QN700A, Samsung QN800A and Samsung QN900A 8K TVs. It was unveiled at the virtual CES 2021 and became available in the US and UK a short time later. It’s currently unavailable in Australia, where instead you can get the similar QN85A.
In terms of UK and US pricing, you’re looking at between $1,499 / £1,799 for the 50-inch model and $3,499 / £3,999 for the 75-inch model. In the US, there’s also an 85-inch model available for $4,999 if you want a truly supersized screen. Compared to the competition, the QN90A is slightly more expensive than other comparable LED-LCD TVs. The new Sony X90J LED-LCD TV starts at $1,099 for the 50-inch model (£1,399 in the UK for the 55-inch version) while LG’s supersized QNED 90 LED-LCD comes in at $3,000 / £3,700. However, it’s nearly the exact same price as the new LG C1 OLED that comes in at $1,799 / £1,699 for the 55-inch LG OLED55C1. From a sheer aesthetic standpoint, there’s nothing to dislike about the Samsung QN90A. It has a beautiful look with premium materials and looks great both wall mounted and on its stand. In terms of design, however, the stand is a bit dicey. When we had the TV fully set up on the stand, with screws fastened as tight as possible, there was still a reasonable amount of wobble to the TV. It wasn’t as bad as the Sony X950H that we lambasted last year for its shakiness, but it’s still much less stable than we’d like. Of course, we can only speak about the 65-inch version of the TV that we had in for testing – the 55-inch TV might be totally fine with its lower weight and center of gravity. One of the reasons the QN90A is a bit more unstable this year is because it’s a bit thinner. Compared to last year, Samsung shaved about half an inch from the depth from the TV which has meant making some compromises on sound quality and stability. That’s not a bad thing if you plan on connecting the TV to an external sound system – like one of Samsung’s Dolby Atmos soundbars – and wall-mounting the TV, but it’s all worth noting. The other issue with the Samsung QN90A’s design is that it only comes with one full-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 port. That could be a slight problem down the road, but the good news is that, for now, all four ports can handle both the PS5 and Xbox Series X at 4K/120Hz, VRR and ALLM. Despite all four ports working well for the consoles, port 3 is the only port to support eARC, so you’ll want to use that for a soundbar. Unfortunately, all of these ports are located directly on the back of the TV and not on Samsung’s OneConnect box, which is only available with the QN95A, Q800A and Q900A models. The QN90A does have a way to hide wires by tucking them into the grooves of the back of the TV – but it’s not as elegant of a solution as the OneConnect box is. What is an elegant solution, however, is the new eco-friendly remote that runs off a solar-powered battery. It works right out of the package, and then re-charges every night by sitting on the edge of the window sill. By the time we wanted to watch TV again in the mid-morning or early afternoon, the remote was fully charged again. Besides being easy to charge, the remote uses Bluetooth, which means it works without line-of-sight to the TV, and it comes with a built-in microphone that can be used to query smart assistants. Overall, it’s still quite solid despite being one of the smaller mainstream TV remotes and the eco-friendliness of it definitely wins it some points in our book. Underpinning the Samsung QN90A is the Tizen smart platform that Samsung has been using for, well, what feels like forever. New this year is the ability to change which smart assistant the TV uses and your options include Alexa, Google Assistant and Bixby. We still don’t think Bixby is on par with the other two, but now that’s less of an issue given the fact that it’s easy to switch to one of the others instead. As for the UI of Tizen, it’s a pretty clean look. Pressing the home button brings up an overlay along the bottom of the screen with your frequently used apps and sources as well as the settings and Ambient Mode. Ambient Mode, more or less, is a lower power mode that helps the TV blend into its surrounding environment while retaining some key information – like the time – up on the screen. It’s been around for a few years now and is still an interior decorator’s dream come true. The other neat built-in feature for Tizen is Samsung’s proprietary Samsung TV Plus app that blends traditional TV channels with streaming channels for a more robust – and free – app experience. Best of all, Samsung TV Plus looks similar to a lot of cable guides, which means browsing for something to watch is relatively intuitive and you can pick from a number of popular networks like ABC News, MTV, Nickolodeon and more. These channels are all ad-supported, so you’ll see an ad every once in a while, but otherwise it’s a boon for Tizen. In terms of app support, all the main streaming platforms are there including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and Hulu. To download any apps that don’t come built into the TV requires you to sign in using a Samsung account – which is admittedly a bit of a pain – and some apps look better than others. Amazon Prime Video, for example, with its HDR10+ support certainly looks better than HBO Max that, when we tried streaming Mortal Kombat, inexplicably defaulted to the fit-to-screen picture setting and couldn’t be changed. In the end we had to use another streaming device instead, which was a bit of a bummer. Speaking of UI overlays, it’s also worth talking a bit more about the Game Bar and GameView features of Tizen. While they certainly can be helpful for console gamers as they confirm the refresh rate of the TV, they’re much more helpful for PC gamers. For example, connecting the QN90A to a PC allows you to control the aspect ratio, however you will need to manually adjust the output of the PC for 21:9 (3840x1600 or (2560x1080) or 32:9 (3840x1080). Some gamers will prefer this format while others will be five with 16:9, but having the option does make a strong case for using the Samsung QN90A as a monitor. To end on a positive note, the TV does support screen casting for most major apps and Apple AirPlay 2. Sharing content to the screen is relatively easy and extremely convenient – plus, if you use a Samsung smartphone or smart watch, you can sync your biometric data to the TV using the built-in Samsung Health app. It’s not worth tossing out your iOS device for if you aren’t already on Samsung’s Android platforms, but it’s a nice perk for those of us who are. Of course, a TV of this caliber is all about picture performance and it’s here that the QN90A really delivers the goods. To wit, most content looks truly jaw-dropping on the QN90A – it’s brighter and more colorful than most other 4K TVs, and thanks to the use of Mini LED, it has better black levels and contrast than other LED-LCD TVs. To understand why that’s the case, however, we have to peel back the layers of the TV and talk about how the Mini LED backlighting system interacts with the QLED technology. The former, as you might know, adds thousands more LEDs to the backlight compared to traditional LED-LCD screens. Those are divided into more zones and those zones can then be better controlled, resulting in better black levels and contrast. When those Mini LED zones are engaged, they can output higher brightness levels than traditional LED arrays and when you combine the higher peak brightness with the additional range of colors provided by the quantum dot filter of QLED, you’ve got better color saturation and more vibrant images. That said, the capability to produce brighter, more color-saturated images is one thing – but knowing when and where to employ that technology is a whole different matter. That’s where the Neo Quantum Processor 4K takes over. Using 16 neural networks, the Neo Quantum Processor 4K analyzes images on a frame-by-frame basis, upscaling the image if it’s coming from a sub-4K resolution using an image database and boosting contrast and color saturation. How much color and contrast can be tweaked by any one of the five picture setting modes. Standard tones down colors and brightness for a more natural picture that will look good in most living rooms, while Dynamic mode is a good fit for rooms with an abundance of natural light. Movie mode adds an almost sepia-like tone to the content, while Film Maker mode turns off motion processing completely for a more cinematic experience. All the modes have their pros and cons, but we found each to be enjoyable in their own way. But speaking of motion processing, it’s worth talking about the new Motion Xcelerator Turbo+ technology that’s used by the Neo Quantum Processor 4K. It’s slightly more judicious in the way it uses judder reduction, but stutter is still an issue because of the way the TV’s native 120Hz refresh rate. Basically, the TV can overprocess some images, giving films a soap opera effect or, worse, making some scenes that have a bit of a natural shaky cam effect look like something from the Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield – it’s non-stop shaking that can really be a turn off. The good news is that you can actually go in and tweak the judder and stutter individually through Samsung’s picture settings and we highly recommend doing so. But what does actual content look like? Games like Returnal on PS5 look amazing, with tear-free motion and very little input latency (sub-10ms) while most 4K HDR movies and shows looked exceptionally good, too. It’s a bit of a disappointment that Samsung still refuses to support Dolby Vision content – but its support of HDR10+ means that shows like Jack Ryan on Amazon Prime Video remain stand-out showcases for Samsung TVs. Would it be better if the Samsung QN90A used self-emissive technology like the purported QLED-OLED we’ve heard so much about? Sure. There is still a small amount of blooming and issues with grey uniformity (most commonly known as the ‘dirty screen’ effect) but there does seem to be some real improvement in these areas year on year. The Samsung QN90A’s sound quality is, well, surprisingly mediocre and feels like a real step back from previous models. Unless you really crank the volume up past half-way (50+), the bass response is barely audible and the highs simply don’t shimmer. Even the mid-range, the focus of most TV shows and movies, can sometimes be hard to make out. Part of the problem here might be that the Samsung QN90A uses Object Tracking Sound Plus with a max output of 60W instead of the 70W OTS+ Pro setup that the Samsung QN800A and Samsing QN900A have. The 10W isn't a huge deal-breaker and it’s better than the 10W speaker systems on other TVs certainly, but it’s a real step down compared to the upper-tier models and even the UK-exclusive Samsung QN95A and the 8K Neo QLED TVs. To put it through its paces, we tried a number of different tracks – movies, TV shows and even some music and games – and the results were largely the same: anemic bass, alright vocals that could be hard to make out at some points (see: Mortal Kombat on HBO Max) and a lack of details in the upper frequencies. Some songs sounded better than others, admittedly, and the Spotify app could get significantly louder than most shows, but the Samsung QN90A didn’t have a large soundstage or convincing holography. That’s severely disappointing as one of the highly touted new features of the Neo Quantum Processor 4K is AI Sound that promises a 3D audio-like experience. Thankfully, Samsung does let you tweak the sound through an EQ if you leave it on the Standard sound mode, however that option will be disabled if you have AI Sound turned on. If you don’t want to use AI and you don’t want to fiddle with the EQ, you can use the Amplify setting to get an uplift in mids at low volumes, which does help alleviate some problems. All that said, you’ll probably want to invest in a soundbar to get the best sound to go with the picture. Should you decide to go with one of Samsung’s soundbars – like the Samsung HW-Q950T – you’ll be able to use the TV’s speakers in tandem with the soundbar for more powerful sound and that’s probably your best option when picking up a QN90A. You want the brightest, most color-rich 4K HDR TV You can’t knock the Samsung QN90A for its brightness. It routinely hits over 1,000 nits with HDR content and can reach upwards of 2,000 nits with the right content. Colors look rich and vibrant, and black levels look pretty nice as well for a QLED TV. You’re buying a next-gen console (or two) Although it doesn’t have four full-spec HDMI 2.1 ports, Xbox Series X runs at 4K/120Hz on all four ports. That means you won’t have to worry about which port gets which console, and can rest easy knowing that this TV will work with both next-gen systems. You’re tied into Samsung’s ecosystem of products It’s not a deal breaker if you don’t have a Samsung smartphone or smart watch, but it does make things a bit easier if you’re already a part of Samsung’s ecosystem of products should you choose to buy the QN90A. You’ll need a Samsung account to download more apps from the Samsung store, however, and should you choose to enable it, the TV can sync health data with your Samsung devices if you want to keep tabs on your biometrics throughout the day. You’re planning on putting it on a low stand that can easily be tipped over With an extremely high center of gravity, the 65-inch version of the TV could easily be toppled if enough force is applied. To that end, we’d highly recommend wall-mounting it, if possible, or at the very least putting it out of reach of any children or animals. You don’t plan on buying a soundbar to go with it Sound performance is a mixed bag on the Samsung QN90A. Sometimes shows and movies sound great, sometimes they don’t. Sometimes music sounds good, but most of the time it’s still lacking bass impact and overall clarity. The solution? You’ll probably want to buy a soundbar to go with this TV. You want perfect black levels and uniformity Until we get that QLED-OLED hybrid we’ve been hearing so much about, it’s impossible to get perfect black levels and screen uniformity from an LED-LCD TV – even one as accomplished as the Samsung QN90A. If you’re after the best black levels – and are willing to risk potential burn in issues – then an OLED might be a better fit for you. "
49,10,pcmag,4.5,https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/samsung-50-inch-class-qn90a-neo-qled-tv,"Samsung's QN90A Neo QLED TV line delivers picture quality that rivals OLED and dual-LCD alternatives, with some of the best contrast we've seen.","Samsung is looking to microLED technology as a potential future for displays, but as of now it’s still wildly expensive and only available for custom-installed projects. In the meantime, the company is staying fairly conventional for most of its TVs, sticking with an LCD panel backed by an LED backlight. It’s pushed what those well-established components can do very far, and that shows in the QN90A, Samsung’s flagship 4K TV. It’s a “Neo QLED” TV, which means it uses that same LCD and LED system, but it pours as much technological prowess as possible into those components to produce a picture that rivals the experimental dual-LCD system of the Hisense 75U9DG and the OLED panel of the LG C1P. At $1,799.99 for the 55-inch model we tested, it's a flagship TV with a price to match, but it produces one of the best pictures we've seen, earning it our Editors' Choice award.  The QN90A looks and feels incredibly sleek, with a bezel-free design that frames the screen with a band of metal and a profile that measures just 1.1-inch thick. The clean front view of the TV is broken up only by a tiny outcropping on the lower right corner of the screen that bears a Samsung logo and hides a multi-purpose button. A flat, square metal stand holds the TV securely upright.All connections on the QN90A except the power cable connector sit on the right side of the back panel. Four HDMI ports (one eARC), two USB ports, an optical audio output, an Ethernet port, a 3.5mm EX-Link (RS-232) port, and an antenna/cable connector all face right and are easy to access. The TV has no analog video inputs.The included remote is just as slim and stylish as the TV itself, with some clever design elements. It’s a thin, flat black wand with a circular direction pad near the top, flanked by menu and playback buttons. Volume and channel rockers sit below the pad; below them are dedicated service buttons for Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and Samsung TV Plus (Samsung’s Pluto TV–like free live TV streaming service). A pinhole microphone near the top of the remote lets you use a voice assistant with the TV.The remote features a built-in rechargeable battery. You can plug a standard USB-C charging cable into the port on the bottom, or flip the wand onto its back to reveal an eco-friendly option: a solar panel that charges the remote if you leave it on a sunny windowsill. That's a nice touch for anyone looking to use fewer disposable batteries.Samsung’s own Tizen smart TV platform powers the QN90A. It doesn’t have the wide selection of apps that you'll find on Amazon Fire TV, Android/Google TV, or Roku TV, but it’s still filled with features. Most major streaming services are available, including Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube (but not Twitch). The platform also supports wireless screen sharing of iOS devices and Macs over Apple AirPlay, and Windows 8.1 and 10 PCs over WiDi. A Multi-View mode shows two sources at once, and when you aren't actively watching something, a low-brightness Ambient mode will display art while consuming less power. There's even a web browser.You can use Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Samsung’s Bixby for voice control, and the TV can directly control and monitor Samsung SmartThings–compatible smart home devices.The interface is feature-rich, but feels a bit clunky compared with other smart TV systems. Samsung tries to automate as much as it possibly can and keep granular options out of reach. Just browsing connected devices requires thumbing through a few directions after pressing the Home button, browsing left to make the source and setting buttons appear. After that, simply switching to a newly connected HDMI device takes an irritatingly long time, since the TV will attempt to identify the device and configure itself to work best with it (something most other TVs don’t do, or at least don’t take 10 to 20 seconds to do it). Picture settings are downright difficult to find: You have to zig-zag through the home screen to the setting button, then up and across the quick-access bar with a handful of settings you can toggle, then up again at the very end to make the full list of options visible. Otherwise, you need to haphazardly flip through icons and a limited number of sliders.We test TVs using a Klein K-80 colorimeter, a Murideo SIX-G signal generator, and Portrait Displays’ Calman software using methodology based on Imaging Science Foundation’s calibration techniques. The Samsung QN90A is a 4K TV with a 120Hz refresh rate. It supports high dynamic range (HDR) content in HDR10, HDR10+, and hybrid log gamma (HLG). It doesn't support Dolby Vision.The QN90A is easily one of the brightest TVs we’ve tested, and it also has incredible black levels, thanks to its use of a MiniLED backlight array (not the same as Samsung’s MicroLED video wall, where LED clusters are used for individual pixels, but still using hundreds of tiny LEDs to adjust the brightness of the picture). Out of the box, with an SDR signal in Movie mode, the TV shows a peak brightness of 395.964cd/m^2 with a full-screen white field and not much change with an 18% white field, and a black level of 0.012. This mode sets Local Dimming to Standard, and with standard dynamic range (SDR) content, that makes a big big difference. Setting Local Dimming to High, peak brightness stays nearly the same at 407.806cd/m^2 with a full-screen white field, but the 18% field brightness jumps to 869.032cd/m^2 with a black level of 0.007cd/m^2. That’s excellent, especially for SDR.HDR is where the QN90A really shows its extremes, though. With an HDR10 signal, the TV’s peak brightness is 886.217cd/m^2 with a full-screen white field, and a blindingly bright 1,910.961cd/m^2 with an 18% field. In this mode, black levels are still fantastic at 0.005cd/m^2. That’s an effective contrast ratio of 367,593:1, one of the highest we’ve seen in any TV.Color performance is similarly strong, but not perfect out of the box. The above charts show the TV’s color levels in Movie mode, with an SDR signal compared against Rec.709 broadcast standards, and with an HDR10 signal compared against DCI-P3 digital cinema standards. In both cases, color is fairly accurate with a bit of drift away from ideal levels, and whites lean just slightly green. The respective color gamuts are also almost completely covered, with only red running just a little undersaturated.BBC’s Planet Earth II looks fantastic on the QN90A. The picture is bright and vivid, with varied and natural shades of green on plants and blue on water and the sky. Fine details like fur and bark look crisp, and can be clearly discerned in both direct light and shade.Deadpool also looks very good on the QN90A, with the reds of Deadpool’s costume appearing well saturated and accurate even under the cool overcast lighting of the opening scenes. In the burning lab fight, the flames look bright and rich, while shadow details can be seen in the same frame.The party scenes in The Great Gatsby show off the QN90A's excellent contrast. The bright whites of balloons, shirts, and servants’ jackets nicely pop, while the cuts and textures of black suites also come through clearly and don’t look muddy at all. Skin tones look natural and well saturated. For gaming, the Samsung QN90A is filled with features. It’s a 120Hz TV with Auto Low Latency mode (ALLM), a variable refresh rate (VRR), and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. Its input lag is also extremely low; measuring with an HDFury Diva HDMI matrix, we saw a latency of just 2.6ms. That easily puts the TV among the best for gaming. Make sure Game mode is enabled, though; input lag with Game mod turned off hit 81ms.Samsung’s flagship 4K Neo QLED is stunning, with an incredibly bright and colorful picture, a stylish design, and low input lag for gamers. Based purely on performance, the QN90A is a winner despite slightly inaccurate colors out of the box. The conventional QLED technology of the QN90A rivals the unique dual-cell system on the Hisense 75U9DG, putting out much more light while producing incredible black levels for even better contrast. Hisense gets an edge on usability, though. Its Android TV platform and easily accessible sources and settings are easier to use than Samsung’s Tizen platform, with more apps and services, and Google Cast in lieu of Apple AirPlay. Amazon Alexa and Samsung Bixby aren’t options on the 75U9DG, but far-field microphones let you use Google Assistant without picking up the remote. It also supports Dolby Vision.On the other hand, Hisense’s top-of-the-line TV is only available in 75 inches, while Samsung offers six different sizes of the QN90A, from 43 to 85 inches. If 75 inches is your sweet spot, the Hisense 75U9DG is one of your best bets and definitely worth considering, especially if you prefer Android TV and/or Google Cast. If you want the best color possible and don't mind it not being as bright as an LED TV, LG’s OLED C1 is another favorite. But for a fantastic picture in a range of sizes without compromising on brightness, the Samsung QN90A earns our Editors' Choice award.

50,10,wired,8,https://www.wired.com/review/samsung-qn90a-tv/,"This 4K flagship is fantastic, even if you plan to watch with all the lights on.","IF YOU’RE SPENDING more than a thousand dollars on a TV, there are very few reasons not to buy an organic light-emitting diode model. Each pixel in an OLED screen acts as its own backlight, and that built-in contrast provides a gorgeous viewing experience.For years, Samsung—which doesn’t make an OLED TV—has been touting that its high-end backlit LED screens get brighter (and thus work better in brighter rooms) than OLEDs from LG, Sony, and Vizio. This claim fell largely short once you got the two technologies side by side. Brightness be damned, without the near-perfect contrast of OLED, Samsung's didn't actually look better. It wasn’t until I got my eyes on the new QN90A that my opinion started to change. Depending on what and where you watch, the QN90A might actually be a better-looking TV. Samsung's Mini LED backlighting inches very close to OLED’s perfect contrast, and speedy processing makes it a perfect companion for high-end gaming PCs and consoles. If you watch in brighter rooms or in large groups from varying angles, it’s probably the best-looking TV for you. Mini LED uses thousands of tiny LEDs to backlight the display, and the technology is now getting very close to OLED-level performance when it comes to blacks, without the limitations imposed by OLED’s Achilles’ heel: brightness. LED TVs can get brighter than OLEDs, which makes them better for eye-catching colors and bright rooms. Think about moving your cell phone screen from a bright room to a dark one; it needs much more backlighting to look good in sunlight. That's important, because not everyone has the luxury of a purpose-built home theater. Brightness has a noticeable impact, especially when OLED's inherent contrast advantage is minimized.The QN90A looks amazing even with the lights on. When I was watching Formula 1 races and soccer matches, the color of the cars and the green of the field were gorgeous. Even dark shows like The Mandolorian looked great. Turn off the lights and it’s one of the most vivid viewing experiences you’ll find. But viewing in super-dark rooms is just about the only time you’ll really notice that the TV isn’t getting quite as black as an OLED can. Turn down the lights and put on a film set in space; you’ll notice there's a touch of “light bloom” around brighter objects, which is when the light from the  backlight bleeds around the sides of the illuminated subject.
